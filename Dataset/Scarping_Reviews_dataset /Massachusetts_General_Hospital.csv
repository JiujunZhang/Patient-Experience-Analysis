0	Richard Reynolds	5	Very nice people but I was shocked to see that no money was being pass at the restaurants they were signs stating no cash that is against the law because money is currency
1	Sandra R Mercier	5	Boston Massachusetts General Hospital is the best place for you to get any information about .about getting a transplants
2	Melodie Goodwin	1	Very poor communication. I would not recommend this hospital unless you can sit by your family member at all times.
3	Amir Amiri	1	I had a test there and for low quality laboratory I never got its result and they billed me twice!! NEVER EVER GO to MGH!!
4	Sherry Collard	5	The doctors in the staff are very friendly and caring
5	Ninochka	5	Thank you is not enough for DR. DOUGLAS BROWN.  This is way overdue, but thank you for your genuine kindness, patience and wonderful care of me during a difficult time and subsequent hysterectomy.  I could not have connected with a better surgeon and all around wonderful human being.  Nina S.
6	Jennifer House	1	Might be a good place but maybe they should check the trash working there!! This post was uncalled for by a nurse that works there
7	Blondie	5	"Thank you to all that have helped us in the efforts of taking care of my daughter! You all have been very kind and helpful in her care.

We know that with your care we will come to  conclusions. Your knowledge and upkeep of it will help millions of people now and for years to come!

We thank you all!"
8	Torrean Slaughter	5	Thank you for good care
9	Felipe Furtado	5	One of the finest hospital in the United States, and the #1 ranked in the East Coast, they provide excellent patient care across all departments, while also carrying out groundbreaking research.
10	Jake Slocum	5	Top notch people and care
11	Jacqui Nazario	5	Staff was very friendly and my kids liked everyone. The children's er staff is amazing.
12	Astrni	1	"So is this your employee??
Pretty unprofessional.
Might want to rethink your staff."
13	Jessica Seth	1	An absolutely Amazing team of doctors and oncology staff took care of my mother. However, as a nurse leader myself- the nursing care and compassion is severely lacking. There is a very poor nursing culture and it shows in how they handle patients and families.
14	Ryan Pehrson	1	"There may be good doctors here, but it’s a bad place for PATIENTS. And it is very clear that they do not care about the patient experience. As one small example. Today we showed up on time for our early am appointment. 15 minutes later we inquired about how long it was going to be.

It was like we were speaking an alien tongue. Then it was as if we were impolite to even dare to enquire about how late they were running. In any other profession, someone who is so flagrantly late all the time wouldn’t have a career at all. We were on time; why can’t they be?

My fiancée was sitting there anxious for over 45 minutes past the appointment time. I’m sure they’re going to diagnose her with high blood pressure now... when really the problem is they have zero focus on patient experience or, bluntly, any sense of professional courtesy."
15	American - Canadian Wrestling Federation	1	"In November 2014, I was admitted to the MGH via the ER; and even though I was a patient of yours for only 48 hours, it truly was the worst experience of my entire life; due to specific ways I was subjected to, which I won't disclose publicly.

I have since written a formal letter to the President's Office with another letter forthcoming.

In closing, to this very day; I am still in therapy (which has now come close to six-figure range in costs) due to the trauma I had sustained and; whether the MGH does not want to believe me, with all respect in mind; I honestly don't care, as it is indeed the truth I'm telling.

Take care, and I truly do wish you the very best."
16	Alexandra A.	4	Quick to use restraints in psych unit. <I was cuffed n stuffed😵😭 Still better than the trash at CHA. Let you have your phone even on suicide watch😉🔫
17	Steven Riendeau	5	One of the greatest hospitals in the world right here our backyard.
18	J Hu	5	I did my CO-OP here during my second year of pharmacy school.  Thanks for training me.  Congratulations for ranking number two nationally in the USNews hospital ranking.  Mass General Hospital along with Brigham and Women’s Hospital are the two principle teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School which is the top ranking medical school in the country.
19	Sana Ahmed	4	Great but they are getting dated.. consult rooms look like those in 70s..
20	Ty Ueda	5	"Been here for 4 weeks now in total, (3 weeks a few months ago and just finishing another. Great place. Nicest docs and nurses. My parents insist on eating the cafeteria food because it’s great.

James on Ellison 14 draws blood the best. Real champ. Someone in HR/PR/Marketing go give him a pat on the back or buy him a coffee."
21	justin mcguire	5	This place is the best in the world!!!! They took very good care of my friend. He was in Rhode island hospital and they sent him home and we went here and they saved his life if you're in Rhode island hospital I suggest you go to Massachusetts General!!!!!! you will survive!!!!
22	Dan Wells	5	This is the undisputed best hospital in the entire world. Anyone that knows anything knows that.
23	MATTHEW P RANUCCI	4	Patience is a requirement and expectation of ALL patients being seen. Allow at minimum 4 hours. Excellent care, nurse gave me shot that was excruciatingly painful! After that she seemed friendly.
24	Julia Burrell	1	Dealing with their medical records department is an absolute nightmare.
25	RUSTY D. HENSON	1	"As a patient in their Veterans ICP, I was looking forward to what was claimed to be the best treatment for PTS. I was excited for this opportunity. When I arrived, I was met with hostility from the program nurse and was traumatized to the point that I was unable to benefit from the program. It was disappointing, to say the least and set my condition back immensely. I hope this was not the case for all veterans but it has created a deeply seeded traumatic event in which I have yet to recover. I have used skills they attempted to teach while there but when applied to that setting, I have been rejected and been unable to communicate with them.  After three official requests (on their forms), I’ve still been unable to receive my records.

Some providers were top notch but the ones who do not act professionally greatly exacerbate the conditions of patients.

They say thing improve with time. A few months ago, I was willing to go back and give them another try. They refused because of my constructive criticism. They were content with whatever the final disposition of me was - no matter what.  Instead of offering to help and possibly improve their program, they left this vet hanging out to dry. 9/14/20 - their action have continued to cause undue terror. I’m grateful for the thousands who have read this.

Now, while thoughts of war still haunt me daily, it is the mistreatment is patients (me) that trigger so much anger and resentment just to hear or see their name... I need the treatment from MassGen.  I think it’s about time to stop the fight. I’m tired. I’ve got nothing left. Since I’ve left there, my tanks have ran dry.  I do not have the strength to go on. Thank you MassGen for helping to ensure there’s nothing left.

I literally cry when I read this review that I wrote. This is something I needed so bad and need even more today. I need the program so bad. I’m grasping for straws only to collect a handful of air. I am so scared. I’m afraid that instead of a straw, I may, instead, wind up with fingers around a rope... :-("
26	Sue Copen	1	So after a brutal 16 hour day of mother’s surgery  and finding out she was at a high risk for stroke,  I left and discovered my ticket missing for parking garage. I explained At a different parking garage ( mine had no cashier so late at night) that I  had gotten there at 8:00 am . Instead of letting me pay and give me a ticket we had to go over to our garage and get registration and drivers license and run BACK over to be able to pay and leave with a ticket. Meanwhile  hospital police parked right in front of us bothering us... really???  You mean to tell me all this was NECESSARY????? Come on mass gen.... let’s leave the m off your name to make it more appropriate considering the treatment.
27	BLAZER KUN	1	Is this the type of people you hire?
28	Erin Daigle	5	I am from Maine and was referred to Mass General for surgery. I was impressed with the knowledge of the surgeons, received excellent care while in the hospital and overall in their care.
29	Jeff Algers	5	Absolutely total respect for this hospital. The dedication and love from the personnel is palpable, commendable. I hope others will join in promoting their excellent work.
30	Mommy Zora: Ana McShan, We Rise	1	"Cant even direct anyone in need of psychiatric help. Just ignore you, lie, and put you on hold for forever. How dare you call yourself one of the top hospitals. Just because you have ""in the process of learning"" experimenting and testing their knowledge out on people. That dont mean nothing other than all of your patients are Guinea pigs to the system just like you are, try it with someone else."
31	Nathalie Polanco	5	The staff is amazing. I had surgery it was so nice. Everything came out great.
32	Aaron Noll	5	This is the best hospital I have ever experienced. The doctors work in teams and are extremely experienced. I fully believe they are among the best in the nation. In addition to all this, I find the MGH staff more genuinely caring and empathetic than any other hospital I know of!
33	Maryellen Shorey	1	Horrible experience there with my daughter.  We lost her due to a lack of understanding and treatment.
34	khai nguyen	1	My friend arm was dislocated and he is in severe pain. We had to call an ambulance to get him here. First, they put us outside for over an hour, until my friend pain was too much He couldn’t take it anymore. They put us in a room so no one can see him suffer. It’s been 2 hours, and no one even take a look at my friend dislocated arm. And we are stuck in this room in the corner. My friend is still in pain, without medication and care.
35	the monkey king	1	"My grandma died in their care. I still dont know what the ""complications"" were for an otherwise simply surgery. Its hard not to feel spite. Im still mourning."
36	Murat Atli	1	"Terrible , only one word , culture of the system is nothing services is crazy
Just terrible"
37	Hannah A	4	"Everyone was very kind and genuine there (ER) - really made me feel like they cared and that allowed a sense of relief.  The hospital even called me the next day to find out how I was doing, which I greatly appreciate and definitely do not receive from my local hospital, even after being there twice.

The wait is going to be long in any area, but that's to be expected as it's an incredibly busy and major hospital. There also aren't many nurses available to answer your questions and when they are they must do it in a hurry, but again that is understandable with how busy they are. So, while less of a wait time and more time with my assigned doctor and some nurses would be nice, I completely understand how difficult it can be to achieve this. The wait and examination rooms, while nicer than many you'll find in hospitals, could still use a little improvement though.

Overall, it was a good visit for a bad situation and I'm very thankful to all, especially the doctor and his assistant who saw me. Definitely worth the hour drive it takes me to get there rather than going to my local hospital.  It's my hospital of choice when I have one.

Also as a side-note, parking is quite affordable - especially the discount they give to patients!

Another side note - cafeteria is great! It's clean with a lot of room and the food is delicious! Though could use a little more allergy-friendly foods and could probably lower their prices a tad."
38	Ana Maria Stuart	5	I had a medical emergency while traveling to Boston. The hospital itself was good, like any other hospital in a big city in the United States, but the people there were extraordinary!! Friday 2am and everybody was smiling and making me feel much better. I am very grateful for everything they did to me, but specially for being so thoughtful and attentive.
39	Naveen Kumar	5	"Hi I am Naveen. I am from India. My Mother who was traveling on June 8th to visit my brother in Boston from Hyderabad(India) she had sudden cardiac arrest at Boston airport. She was joined to CICU at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. here for 8 weeks now in total, Great place.This is the best hospital I have ever experienced. The doctors work in teams and are extremely experienced.

Countless thanks to the entire doctor’s and all the staff who are working day and night for keeping us in the pink of health. Wishing them heartiest gratitude for their greatest contribution."
40	Tara Marks	5	Great medical care. Great staff
41	Andrea Duncan	5	hospital I have ever experienced. The doctors work in teams and are extremely experienced
42	Timothy Wanamaker	5	Can't say enough about the great care I received there. The team of Drs saved my life and limbs due to a very aggressive tumor Chondroblastoma. Thanks to the Drs and Nurses whom took care of me..,
43	simon wu	1	I went to MGH walk-in before and it was great but the second time I went in I waited a long time and once the doctor told me what my condition was she didn't listen to my question or concerns and just kick me out to pay the bill.
44	Ms. Delgado	4	"This hospital is very busy as there are so many types of specialists here. They are very professional and caring.
Use Valet Parking otherwise your going to keep going around for a parking spot in the garage, but make sure the Doctor's office gives you a validation or it's going to be pricey."
45	Julie G	1	The hospital staff deliberately and knowingly deprived me of drinking water for a number of days. My eyes, mouth, entire body were parched and suffering. How did they not know I was dangerously dehydrated? Afterward, I was very traumatized over what had happened. The hospital admin continued to attempt to silence me over it. Because I have decided to continue to speak out about hospital abuse, there has been retaliation and it hasn't been legal. I have consulted attorneys and also went to the state legislature.
46	Paul Sullivan	2	Delivery was great other than that jammed 2 in a room husbands are told to fend for themselves.
47	nunya stockson	1	Disgusting staff.
48	LaNorski	4	"This hospital does a great deal of good, and 99 percent of the time I get quality care. I have been there for studies,tests,  as a patient, I have had surgery there, you name it. There has been only one time I have not been pleased with MGH, and I have never seen a repeat of it. It was in recovery, and the nursing staff was somewhat rude and not well informed on meds. I couldn't leave the recovery because you are suppose to be able to go the bathroom, when they had to run around to give me my daily meds that I take regularly, they wanted me to take my Ritalin for ADHD... I informed the nurse I didn't need to take it and after having surgery shouldn't take a stimulant, her reply was, ""Just take it""""  Then a group in interns, I think, came to check on me...said I'd be going home. So I called my family to come get me, and they drove in. After waiting for hours one of these snot nosed inters said I couldn't go home because I hadn't gone the bathroom. So, they finally use a catheter and I was able to start going to the bathroom. At 11 PM, they sent me home with a medical ride, and the case worker put in the notes they had to send me home that way because , "" my family didn't show up""! That made me so mad, instead admitting the right hand didn't know what the left was doing, they blamed my family!??!? These young interns need to get their head straight, the nurses need to know their medications AND LISTEN TO THE PATIENTS! That was my only bad experience with MGH, the other times, there were no problems or issues. Perhaps the staff was just off their game that night, or perhaps I just got a bad team. I don't know, I would not right off MGH for one bad experience but never forget, they are there to make money!"
49	Major Insight	5	Great care, top-notch..
50	TitletownAKA Boston	1	I have to give them a one star.  When I was going through a divorce, I brought my daughter there to talk with someone just to make sure that she was handling it well.  The first thing they wanted to do was to put her on medications.  It's a good thing that I'm a nurse and know better.  I left the office with the script in my hand and threw it out.  I never went back.  All doctors want to do is medicate you.
51	Marat Mekhtiyev	1	"Went in for a torn muscle in leg. Unprofessional staff, inappropriate comments; laughing, ""living the dream"" and worst when I asked if someone could wheel me to down the hall for  drink I get this ""if you can get up to go to the bathroom you can walk to the vending machine and get your own drink"" after she saw me struggle to get to the bathroom. Waited 3 hours, doctor came in confirmed it was a torn muscle said will do a  cat-scan. She also said her colleague will come in to take a look also. Waited 30 minutes. Colleague looked like she hasn't slept in 24 hours and wanted me out. very short and told me their specialist isn't here so no point of a CAT scan and to come back on in 3 days when they will be there. Mind you I was in extreme pain, they gave me a Tylenol.... In a panic I asked if they could at least ultrasound it she did so for 15 seconds and said yes its torn along with internal bleeding. SO now sitting and waiting in pain for ""specialist"". They gave me a leg boot which hurt more then it helped along with crutches. Wonderful hospital.... Never Again.

Only positive was the nurse offering to wheel me up to my car and the security guard who saw me struggle getting inside and wheeled me in.

4 hours and less than 5 minutes of service, do yourself a favor and see an urgent clinic. I promised you will get more help much faster."
52	Gerald Barrett	5	Having been shipped to other hospitals my wife and I requested a transfer to MGH.  The difference in atmosphere was so much better at MGH.  I had open heart surgery.  They explained everything and made sure I understood before proceeding.  The staff could not have been better.  I am speaking about the entire staff.  I cannot understand why anyone would go anyplace else .  My results have been great.  I believe they hold themselves to a higher standard and it shows.
53	Patson Lim	5	The oldest and best hospital in the area very skillful and highly knowledgeable doctors who understand procedure and what has to be done very well.  Great Payment options
54	Meghan Nyberg	5	All hospitals have their fair share of problems, but this is by far the very BEST hospital in the world. The Dr.'s, Fellows and Nurses are kind, generous with their time and knowledge. They saved my Mother's life.
55	GOLE R	5	Amazing staff at this hospital, my mother had a bad work accident where her left index finger was pretty much cut off, she went to baystate hospital at first since and they said they would have to amputate the finger unless she wanted to go across the state to Mass General which she chose to do. Probably the best decision she has ever made, her doctor was Dr. Kyle Eberlin who is a very skilled orthopedic/reconstructive surgeon. He was able to completely reattach her finger and now (2 years later) she has 90% movement back in the finger and feeling. The nurses there are also the best nurses i have ever come across in my life.
56	Frank Gimlet	5	Mass general hospital is one of the best hospitals in the word,had to go there for some unusual pain when I got to the emergency room I was checked out immediately  I felt they were really caring and very professional they did a lot of tests the doctor who checked me out was very thorough in his test and all the questions he asked to make sure he didn't miss anything that could be a problem after the hospital location is very easy to get to.
57	Ocie Eico	1	"Worst hospital ever! I’m actually here now been here for 2 hours in a corner inside of pediatrics.. 20 doctors and 10 nurses passed by me and no one helped.. mind you I’m in the ER so yes there’s a wait. But when you start to
Skip me and put me in a corner that’s when it start to get annoyed. I asked the nurse who placed us “in the corner” when was the doctor coming by. She seemed surprised and said they didn’t come by yet. And I said. Nope. Now here it is 3 hours later my daughter still coughing and the waiting room is getting full and guess what still no doctor. This is a horrible horrible hospital please don’t send your kids. Take the trip to children’s."
58	Brian Holman	1	Is this one of yours
59	Abdu Emsalem	1	"Very disappointing!
Suffered severe abdominal pain, ambulance took me to Mass general hospital. Despite telling them upfront I have billiary colic there was no good exam by the ER doctor nor they reach the diagnosis they did ct of my abdomen and concluded that I have gastroenteritis!! Pain was intense. Being a doctor my self asked the doctor not to give me narcotic rather to Give me Toradol as it is first line for biliary colic.
They discharged me suffered 4 days without relief went to another hospital closer home. Found that I have sever gall bladder inflammation required immediate surgery indeed took the surgery next morning. Surgeon told me it was big and intensely inflamed also was quite challenging surgery.
Missed diagnosis and was overconfident ignoring the fact that I gave them the diagnosis upfront yet not listening !! Overconfidence was clear on nursing and MD staff. Were unpleasant and judgmental
I am very disappointed and surprised for the care I received"
60	Molly H	1	Dr Tello did not treat my family members symptoms or assist in treating concerns that I brought up and that led to his death.  Dr Tello is not trustworthy.  This makes me think that partners does not look into what doctors they are hiring and makes me think twice about going to another doctor in the system.  As a healthcare professional,  partners should be sure the care providers are in the position to treat and prevent diseases in patients with SAFE patient outcomes. I hope no other patient or family has the experience what I did.
61	Jes Santos	1	Worst hospital I’ve ever been too! Starting from the Dr I seen to the over all care I got! I would never go back there don’t care how good they say they are. My experience was so horrible and horrific I’m still paying for the damage they did to me over a year ago. Dr. Forcione is one of the worst Dr’s I seen in my life! What a hack! With Dr’s like him there is no way in the world they are as good as they say,I lived it,they are hacks run while you can!
62	Courtney Snyder	3	"I had a very little luck getting a response to messages left with the answering service. When I did, finally, get through to Dr. Borges office, Valerie was a great help and sympathetic to the frustration I was feeling.

Since sending in my records, Valerie has stayed in touch explaining what I could expect. Dr. Borges was recommended to me by my (BI) Cardiologist-his endorsement was ""Dr. Borges is the go to doctor for other doctors having neurological issues"".

I look forward to hopefully having a consultation with the doctor."
63	K	5	Thanks for taking such great care of my father, MGH! High quality medical care.
64	Shane Tristan Yoder	5	Great hospital, if you ever need to be sent elsewhere, they always send you to the best places. I had pneumonia in 2011 and they took good care of me for the month I was there.
65	Phil L.	5	"Dr.  Carrie Allen Coleman.  Who is my Gynecologist
Did my surgery on May 22, 2017, I am not a fan of hospital or some Dr., but let me say this, you will never find another doctor like her, she is a remarkable person.  She is very patient, easy-going and treat you gently with utmost kindness.

I am really impress with her and will always be thankful to her for the great job and care she alway give to me.

You need a Gynecologist, find her..."
66	Laura	5	All I can say is wow, the physicians in this hospital are truly a blessing. The physicians in the neuropsych department saved my brother's life, He was suffering from a rare and difficult type of OCD to treat, harm OCD... was basically disabled for 6 years... psychologists and long term care centers said they couldn't help him. Finally the only thing to do was surgery, a cingulotomy. It was scary at first to think about but now six months later my brother is a new man, after being at home not able to go to college or work for six years, he started college again, has a job, and is SO HAPPY now that he isn't suffering with horrible obsessive thoughts all the time. He is a completely new person. Thank you for bringing my brother back to us.
67	John A Mo	5	Spent three years volunteering here. All of my experiences with the physicians, staff, and patients back up its reputation as a world-class hospital. MGH is #1!
68	Salem Almehairi	5	This is the best hospital I have ever experienced.
69	Adriana Trajkovski	5	Spoke with Dan in the New Patient Information Dept of Psychiatry. He was extremely knowledgeable, patient and kind. Was in no rush to get me off the phone and genuinely wanted to help. We need more people like Dan.
70	Susan Thornton	5	I travel here from South Carolina to see Dr. Hadlock.  She is a top notch doctor and this facility is one of the best. Well worth the distance that I travel.
71	Da Shu	5	I didn't actually go to MGH, but I have talked with the receptionist of the patient financial department and asked her several questions, she was very friendly and gave me detailed explanation to each of my question, helped me a lot. I'm truly grateful.
72	Peter B	1	"Prescribes anti-depressants like they're candy, lies to you about the side effects and withdrawal, and ignores all other complaints until you wind up in their ER. In the ER they leave you for hours, moving you from waiting room to waiting room with no clear direction for treatment. In the 2 years I've been there I still struggle with my original GI problem (which I had to diagnosed myself and bring to a doctor's attention) but now I have the added pleasure of dealing with Cymbalta withdrawal.

Dr. Joseph Yarze assured me withdrawal symptoms were minimal. Anyone who knows about Cymbalta knows this is not true.

Also, don't bother with Patient Advocacy. They will just try to convince you you're at fault. I trusted you guys and you guys took my money and wiped your hands clean of all responsibility.

I get that working in a hospital setting is a high stress job and I respect the doctors and medical professionals who do this, but just because I don't have an extreme or highly visible condition doesn't mean I'm not suffering and I deserve the treatment I paid for which I believe I never received."
73	Ian Wilson	5	It's a place where you get the best Healthcare in Massachusetts
74	April	5	The emergency room doctors and nurses went well and beyond for my daughter, extremely grateful
75	Mr. Nate	1	My son had a terrible experience there and it's now nearly traumatized for life I would not recommend any of the staff emergency unit or in general anyone there
76	Susan Ferretti	5	Great hospital filled with incredible people.
77	Scott Dalrymple	5	Best medical you could ever need!
78	Vaughn Allen Goodwin	5	This is an amazing place for treatment. They have mastered the art of taking care of a patient well. The place is big. The technology is awesome and the support is warm. I would not go anywhere else for my medical treatment.
79	FD G	5	Nurse Mary P in the ER is by far the best nurse I've ever had in any hospital. I was sitting there in pain, and she'd get me to giggle and for a brief moment I'd forget about the pain. Always smiling, even when I asked a million and one questions. The hospital is clean, very clean. Their technology, and commitment to providing the best care can not be matched at any other hospital. Period.
80	Jose Santos Ferrufino Funes	5	"I am glad to be hiere  all the staff are very awesome.
Tanks all team work."
81	Pat Young	5	My Mom was told she would live six months to a year.  Then, she went to Mass General.  My Mom has fought Cancer with Mass General for eight years now.  The staff at Mass General are dedicated, amazing and caring people.  Thank you so very much for what you do!  I am so grateful we can celebrate Mom's Birthday on 1/2/15!!  Thank you!!
82	Amy Furmanick	5	"Sept 1st 2018, I had an aneurysm and was med flighted from Laconia NH. I had collapsed twice walking out of my bathroom so my 12 year old daughter called 911. Thank God she was still awake at 130 am or I wouldn't be here. Laconia emts treated me terribly and thought I overdosed..telling me multiple times that I need to ""stand up"" as I was crying on my kitchen floor curled up in a ball holding my head.
My whole stay at mass general (all 17 days) was great. I was brought ice cream at 1 am when I couldnt sleep, since I was bed ridden one nurse ""Grace"" even washed my hair while I was laying in the bed, tried to get the knots out of my hair. She was incredible and such a sweet caring girl.
I was moved up from the ICU to the floor above after 15 days, I was told I'd have more freedom without being hooked up to all the machines, I thought that meant I could go get a soda. I was stopped at the elevators and told I couldn't go off the floor. The woman at the desk who stopped me went out of her way and brought a soda to my room. This hospital and their staff are incredible. They saved my life as most people die before reaching the hospital. I'm incredibly grateful to be alive and the hospital staff made my hospital stay more comfortable. I can't thank you all enough for all you have done for me.
Only complaint is one of the social workers. Not the one with the short curly hair..but the other one. She was so rude to my dad."
83	Jayna Marie Arsenault The Certifiable One	5	I love MGH it's my main hospital. My PCP is in the Chelsea Massachusetts General Hospital. I had surgery here in MGHB and they did a really amazing job, it was my appendix, that was leaking but the emergency room in Brockton thought it was just a stomach bug so they gave me antibiotics. The antibiotics calcified the leaking part of my appendix that created a mass that was connected to my right phillopian tube, right colon, some intestines, & the appendix. All came out at once at the MGHB I got the Royal treatment was awesome I didn't want to go home. The MGH is the only hospital that I trust. My family all goes there, my sister in-law works there, my neice & nephew were born there & my Mom had her 2 brain surgeries there plus a lumpectomy there. It's an amazing place with awesome people who do unbelievable things. I highly recommend this hospital if you need one in the area. It's the best I've ever gone to. Fantastic great job thanks for everything MGH. XoJaynaoX
84	Teri Nicks	5	I love this place because I work here
85	Michelle Muhammad	5	"I recently had surgery at MGH and it was by far my most memorable and pleasant hospital stay/experience ever. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The facility was clean throughout. It never ""smelled like a hospital""--for which, I'm grateful. My surgeon was very knowledgeable and his residents all had a positive bedside manner, which is often lacking among young doctors. I was an out-of-state patient and so far, the trip up to Boston has been worth every effort."
86	Scott Doner	5	"All my experiences with Mass General, from my pre-op visits, my surgery to my post-op visits have been pleasant and professional.  When I showed up for blood-work and radiologic imaging, I never had to wait any more than 5 minutes.  My stay on the surgical recovery floor was a ""good "" experience, being well attended to, handled with care and respect.  My discharge occurred in the evening after normal discharge hours. The volunteer attendant that wheeled me down to the front doors decided that my wife would not be able to wheelchair me over to the Wyndham Hotel, so he attended me all the way over to the hotel lobby on a chilly evening, without even a jacket on!  I can't thank him enough, and he refused any tip!"
87	Paula G	5	Excellence at it's finest.
88	Ovais Khan	1	Service at this hospital has been getting worst and worst every time I come here.  I came in because I felt pain in the back of my neck and head along with chest pain.  Two days into my stay at the hospital I am told I have severe blockage in my right artery and I am serious and will need to stay for further test and possible treatment.  The irony is that it’s been more than 36hrs I was told this info my the floor doctor and the nurse and that the cardiology team member will be coming to speak to me yet here I am still waiting almost approaching two days since my test results came with no further testing scheduled or put on any medication to help treat my condition.  Laying in bed watching the time go by.  Well I have decided to take my chances and given them till 4pm which is three hours away and if nobody from cardiology comes by or no further course of action is taken I am walking out of here.  God forbid if something happens to me I just want you guys to know if you are planing on coming or this hospital please look into other options first since this is really really disappointing as it seems just a place of business with no morals and ethics.  I am at MGH observation unit patient record 4127158 incase somebody has any decency to address the matter at the “Great institution of MGH Boston hospital”
89	Mathew MacCord	3	Only come here if you need surgery, or IV fluids they are not willing to find out underlying causes if your too complicated they turn you away.
90	Gregg V.	5	There's a reason they call this Man's Greatest Hospital.
91	Christian Sorgi	5	Overall good experience. They were compassionate however they were so busy it felt like they didn't have time to answer all of my questions. The rooms were clean but the wait was long.
92	E	1	Visited Oral and maxillofacial surgery.  Been here twice, waiting for an hour each time (1 hr 20 min this time) the doctors saw me for 5 min and were basically quick to recommend surgery and quick to dismiss when I asked for alternatives. Very disappointed, what a waste of work hours.
93	Anita Mohan	5	After a colonoscopy without anesthesia I cannot recommend  or praise Dr. Casey and her amazing team at the Endoscopy Unit at MGH enough. They were supportive, friendly and kind - not to mention highly professional and efficient. It is at stressful times like this that you really appreciate the empathetic side of a great medical team. Thank you for making what is a pretty tough procedure into a good experience.
94	Carla Ciulla	5	My PCP is through MGH, I've been going here for years, it's a great hospital. The staff is always friendly and attentive. Wether it was myself or family there, nothing but good to say about MGH. Even the other locations they have are good, ie., Revere, Chelsea..etc.
95	Dr. Serge The Nutrition Scientist	5	We spent almost a year on the pediatric floor when my son was getting a variety of treatments. Everyone was very understanding and kind to us. Thank you!
96	Chris Ferry	5	"MGH had been a great hospital to me. It is one of the leading hospitals in the country.

The staff are all amazing and make sure that every patient is treated well.

The campus covers a few blocks, and there are enough signs to point you in the right direction. Then they have specific desks set up in the buildings just to answer questions and direct you to wherever you need to go.

There are cafes inside, along with lots of options right in the area like a CVS, Whole Foods and other restaurants.

There are a lot of quality hospitals in Boston and MGH always ranks in the top places."
97	Edmond Taverdyan	1	My mother died at this hospital in 2002. The Dr who operated on her was named Dr John Wayne.....i rememeber bcuz she said it was like the actor. When she was in the ICU i asked some nurse an innocent question and she barked at me rudely while my mother lay on her death bed......it hurts to think it was THAT nurse who was taking care of my mom. I wont bring race into it....but i personally have ZERO respect for this hospital or its staff. I gave one star......TILL THIS DAY. We NEVER got a word from the Dr as to what happened to her.....what went wrong....anything? She went into surgery......came out....called me......went into a coma and died. Only god knows what happened. TERRIBLE hospital and staff if u ask me.
98	Rene Villalta	1	Worse wait i ever been threw went in many times early and it takes more then 2hours to get seen and when you do its another 1hr wait and all they advice you is simple. things and done even help like were is all the help the workers do i just walk away cuz of the wait and help myself get better. Doctors and nurse's dont know how to help anymore its all about the money and not helping people like it should be
99	Timothy Steele	1	"Went to the “medical walk in” with my son.  Over a 2 hour wait, rude, no information.  Pathetic and the whole staff should be ashamed of themselves.

It isn’t difficult to update a patient, parent or loved one.  I will never be back here nor my family, I’ll be changing doctors as well.  This is just beyond pathetic"
100	Rick H	5	The best hospital in the country.  Compassionate care, and a high degree of professionalism. As well as the latest in treatment technology.
101	Lindsay Weiss	3	"I love this hospital but the weekend parking supervisor at the fruit street lot was completely patronizing and rude to me.  He told me he could help me with my parking dilemma but ""wouldn't"".  He was a man on a power trip.  I love MGH but can't imagine they would employ such a thoughtless man to run a big part of their business."
102	Jerome I. Johnson	1	The worst hospital to go to for emergency services. I had to walk out after waiting 3 hrs and ask the nurse why is taking so long they got me sitting on a chair for that long with stomach problems. She didn't know where the doctor was. I said probably taking a nap some where. 3hr waiting with no word from nobody smh. Time to change hospital
103	E L	5	Great hospital with a lot of world class doctors. Next to Mass Eye and Ear. Great location, exceptional care.
104	emi Shell	5	Dr. Clinton was my OB for my somewhat complicated twin pregnancy this winter. Near the end of my pregnancy it became clear that my 2nd twin was going to be breech at delivery. While many OBs would have considered this an indication for c-section, Dr. Clinton very confidently explained that if I could deliver my first twin vaginally he could do a breech extraction for my second twin. I had never heard of this and thought maybe it was a simple routine procedure however it turns out not all OBs are comfortable with this procedure even at MGH. On the night of my induction there were not going to be any OBs on call who were comfortable doing the extraction and I faced the possibility that I would have to have both a vaginal delivery and a c-section or simply opt for a c-section. But Dr. Clinton took it upon himself to make a plan to cover my delivery as an on-call provider. When the time came, I gave birth to my first twin vaginally and then Dr. Clinton and is team went to quick work performing a complicated series of maneuvers which safely extracted by second twin from my womb! I cannot express how grateful I am for this outcome and for Dr. Clinton's dedicated to providing the very best care to me and my family!
105	Anne Lorigan	5	"Simply the best!!  They have saved my life literally, 4 times. A massive GI bleed and I was brought to Massachusetts General Hospital.
Later I got scars on my liver due to the bleed. The scar tissue caused liver cancer twice. I was treated and put on ""the list"" for a liver transplant.
On the forth call it was the perfect liver for me. That was four years ago.
The first time that I went to MGH I was17, on my own. My hand had gone through a window.
I took the subway to the hospital. They treated me so well that I applied and got a secretary position. This was in 1979.
I could talk all day about my second home.
MGH has been rated number 1 hospital in the USA and additionally rated number 1 hospital to work in 👍🏽♥️♥️"
106	Celia LaBarbera	4	I have been coming here for as long as I can remember and there are amazing doctors.
107	Jared Allsopp	1	One of the police touched me inappropriately and hit me in the face after.The groped me and tried taking my pants off.
108	hi bye	1	I took my 8 year old daughter with a abdominal pain and a lot o fever,came back and they returned her to the house to take her back for the same pain and I just said it was stomach pain without taking any special exam and by the third time  I was sure it was a symptom of appendicitis  without being a doctor and I told them and they wanted to return to the house to see that the fever rose very high there if they tried exams  resulting in peritonitis 😤😭
109	Melissa Kierstead	5	Best hospital. Nurses have been wonderful
110	Matthew S.	1	"Be prepared to have lost a limb or be bleeding from your eyes to have them see you at the walk in clinic here. I showed up one afternoon with a severe case of bronchitis to the point where I couldn't eat or swallow only to be turned away because they were ""too busy"" to see me. I would have waited, I had nowhere else to be, but no, every single doctor was busy and they were closing at 7. Mind you it was around 4 pm and there were maybe three other people in the waiting room. The receptionist just stared at me until I left. Clearly their priority is taking care of people...worthless."
111	Foucaldian Bruno	1	"I'm a professor at MIT. I had sinus surgery (turbinate reduction and septoplasty) about a year ago at MGH. The surgeon, Dr Sedaghat, kept on saying you'll breath so much better after the procedure... well, my right nostril is now completely clogged, which wasn't the case before. Worse, they have no clue about what happened (Dr Sedaghat just said I must have made a mistake), sent me to another specialist at MGH (in plastic surgery) who simply told me it might improve. It was eight months ago. And I hasn't. No follow up appointment since. Let alone the fact that I mentioned bad reactions to morphine and they still used a massive dose for anesthesia,
which made me very sick (though morphine was actually not needed according to the surgeon I consulted in France recently and who will perform surgery again). I spent the day in the post-operative room extremely nauseous... What they gave me didn't help at all. When I went back home, I took a pill of Dramamine, the most basic OTC anti-emetic pill. Nausea went away in 20-30 min! Last, MGH treats you like a number. The Sinus Center staff was hardly polite and they don't answer the phone when needed. Really poor service, and awful experience in all respects."
112	Carol Swanburg	4	My dad was transferred to MGH from Portsmouth Regional after major complications following heart surgery and they saved his life. I am very appreciative of the doctors and nurses on the White 11th floor Bigelow F team. They were able to identify that he had a strep infection in his blood by doing a blood culture and treated him for it and now he is back home. The nurses and nursing assistants were great and did everything with a smile! The only thing that would have made it better was if he had a private room, because one of the roommates he had for a day and a half was yelling all night and kept him awake.
113	Gege Fox	5	I spent 5 weeks in the burn unit. The staff was great!
114	XohvyFN	5	Great hospital, I go there too, very good for health care
115	Angelina Mansour	1	My husband  family  works there and we live in buffalo and I have autoamune dease and my husband house is filled with lead and lots of holes in ceilings. The pipes have never been changed.   Thank you
116	Billy Cocorochio	5	I was at the M.G.H a few days ago, my girlfriend fell and hurt herself, It took about 2 hours from the time we stepped into the Fast Track, she was reviewed immediately, then taken right to X=Ray, the DR kept us well informed threw the entire wait witch was nothing flat, they informed her that she had fractured a rib, explained what she should do for recovery, treated her pain and we were finished, also there is a pharmacy located in the hospital, The entire visit was totally enjoyable. I recommend this Fantastic Hospital to anyone. Thank You M.G.H.
117	GG	1	Guys you have a lot of money. Spend some on training those people who answer the phone calls. Not professional at all. Also, do QA on the phone calls. It's their to ensure quality of your service, if you do care!!
118	Samnang Heng	1	I give you one star because deaf people not like writing or read lip. They want to LIVE ASL interpreter. We have Human right.
119	cat wu	4	Rating is really depends on which doctor you have, I have amazing ones and had bad ones. most of them are very professional and nice tho.
120	Andrea Clocchiatti	5	I have been here for a minor but recurrent problem in my foot. Doctors very kind and professional pointed me to the right treatment
121	Kanwaljit Singh Mangat	5	Great place for getting urgent medical care God forbid if you need one
122	James Garcia	1	CAN I GO LOWER THAN 1 STAR?!? THEY KILLED MY GRANDFATHER! My grandfather was recovering in the icu perfectly from his tumor removal. I did not know but they drugged him with 3 drugs that make him not in his right mind for decisions. Later they slowly overdosed him on morphine which later he passed away from it. The staff were rude and when we tried to argue they called security. Don't step foot in this piece of unconstructed hospital. If you want to let your loved ones get murdered then visit this hospital. I regret having the surgery here and wish I could go below one star.
123	T.J. Day	5	Nice place to have a party at a world class medical facility.
124	Vone Chanvong	5	Thank you to all the doctors and nurses for helping me to battle this cancer. You are my team of angels.  🙏
125	Samanntha Silveira	4	"Iam brasilian ....if need help

126	Nathan Harding	5	M.G.H is by far the best hospital in this country doctors are great but the Nurses are the best in the world they make that hospital GREAT!!! They are kind giving and exceptionally warm love those Nurses on Blake 8 Cardiac icu.
127	Demirevs Demirevs	5	"I'm really very helpful!
Have a nice Christmas and a Happy 2016 Year!"
128	绮美暮霭	1	It's the most worse service offer here. I made a phone call to Dr Chang who just saw me a week ago to make a fellow appointment. when then phone get reached the office, a women told me that  they never head this doctor's name. What's the
129	Adrian B	1	"The healthcare service was not good in the ER room. (I had just been unconscious/ talked incoherently after being hit by a car). The bandage provided would stick to the sutures over the next few days, and replacing bandages would be painful. They did not assess my situation carefully at all. They noted I had full sensation in my upper extremities and full range of motion. This is impossible! I still have Axillary nerve damage more than 2 months on from the accident. CT scans and x-rays were done more than 4 hours after the incident.

Days later, another clinic provided me with Adaptic, a non adhesive dressing which would have been useful from the beginning! The situation report written by MGH was written with very poor English, it doesn't really make sense.

The sutures did not heal very well, at all. They skipped certain areas, and used Steri-Strips instead, as that would be easier for them. Now it is scarring badly.

The hospital lost my wallet and all of its contents too! I asked several different people where my wallet was, and they would leave, and never come back to my hospital bed. I had to ask more than 5 times, to get an explanation as to why they lost it. It was really disappointing time in MGH.

They then wanted to kick me out of the hospital at 2.30am, after they gave me hydroxymorphone. I could barely stand."
130	Julia Sarah Terceros	5	My mother is the best nurse and she will take great care of you
131	Nancy Tempest	5	Fantastic bedside manner.The best hospital in the country.Thanks for being there for my father.
132	Partizan	5	"I want to say THANKS for all doctors and nurses in Emergence department MGH. Its very competent, educated and unbelievable polite people !!! I say: THANK YOU !!! You are the Best ever !
GOD Bless you all"
133	Charlie Feng	1	you can not imagine that how slow the hospitol is. If I am a illness people who want to get treatment from this hospital. I think that I may get crazy on my mind. How come it take at least 4 hours for a doctor to deal with a sick person. Did they think about the feeling of sick person?? They should realize how serious this problem is!!!!!
134	Jennifer Stadnik	5	Quite impressed with everyone in the pediatric GI center.  They were very pleasant and Dr. Moran was wonderful in explaining everything.
135	Gloria Cuervo	5	VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND SERVICES. THANKS.
136	Veronica Duarte	5	Take n good care of my baby bro. Fighting for his life  due to liver cancer. Plz say a pray for Richey Botelho and  everyone else in need of a prayer.
137	Elly-May O'Toole	5	Best hospital to bring someone in an emergency if you want them to live.
138	cici brown	1	"I've been a patient here for 3 years now (seeking a new place to go). I tried to have my medical records transferred here and was told that my previous hospital didn't use the same record keeping system, so they wouldn't be able to use my medical history at all. Also they have created a medical record history for me and it has false information they refuse to remove. You can't say someone has an illness without testing them for it.

Every time I call the receptionists and operators in EVERY department are inept and condescending. When I leave voice mails at the ankle and foot clinic (because no one in this department answers the phone) no one ever calls me back.

Most times you have to wait 2 to 4 months for an appointment. I have tried switching doctors and departments but there is the same lack of treatment in every department.

Also most of the doctors are pretentious and have a superiority complex. I've explained several times that we are partners in my health care journey, and that it is not a dictatorship...they don't know how to respect their patients."
139	Tim Mckinnon	1	So there is a nationwide opioid addiction epidemic. I'm here with 2 broken legs from a car accident. The Dr is more than willing to give you opioid pain killers. But when I ask for a pain medicine that's not addictive they laugh at me and say no. Cannabis is not addictive and helps with the pain just as much. Good job. I blame these hospitals for making addicts
140	sean guerin	5	one of the best in the world, saved my friends life after brain aneurism
141	Claressa Dionne	1	horrible communication no one knew what was going on with my family member there. Everyday there was a new team consisting of new people (students/residents) that knew nothing about their patient. I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to go there for any sort of care!
142	Erik O	5	Took excellent care of my father. Cured him of an illness he had been suffering from for nearly 20 years.  Thank you Mass general!
143	David Wolniewicz	5	Are you kidding me? Best in the world. Period
144	Craig Issod	5	What can I say? This hospital represents the best available health care - probably in the USA. It's a historic places (first public hospital in US) that has grown with the times. The community has supported it to the tune of billions of dollars making it into a small city within itself. The Neuro units - from surgery to intensive care to the 2 Neuro floors in the Lunder Building - represent the top of the line.
145	NIL Fantasy Studio	5	Best Hospital ever
146	Debbie Perkins	5	My husband was life flighted down from Lewiston Me. They saved his life by doing a triple by pass. He is home now and doing well.

154	Dorothy Carlson	1	They tout their own praises but cannot treat or dont know how to treat Bertolotti Syndrome.
155	Jeremy Irland	5	I had a very bad series of broken bones and soft tissue tearing. Every single person I worked with at MGH from the doctors and nurses and everyone else I encountered... I was treated like a human being. I was so thankful I was transported to this hospital. :) if you are in the unfortunate position to need a hospital, I hope you can find your way to MGH.
156	Brianna Konopka	1	horrible. They took over 3 hours and didn’t help whatsoever. Such a waste i could’ve went to a pet store and they would’ve done more than they did. Pathetic.
157	Michael Keith	4	That was the very best best heliport on top of massachusetts general hospital is the greatest hospital i ever seen on the.largest bostons maps ever
158	christina gordon	5	This place is the best  in the world it is nothing like Melrose-Wakefield Hospital because that place stinks
159	Elliott Management	1	WAY overrated! Too busy and no real interaction with patients. All ALGORITHMS. If you need a procedure done maybe go here, but not for urgent care, unless you are a trauma victim, in which case what choice do you have, anyway? Go to bwh or somewhere else if you have a choice
160	Christopher Gauthier	5	The best of the best hospital in the world

163	Samantha Battis	1	"We have used the Massachusetts General Hospital franchise for a number of years, and at a number of their various locations. My son has autism, with other complex medical issues, and overall their service and treatment for my son has been impeccable. Their knowledge and family support at the Lurie Family Autism Center has been stellar. I am forced though, after a recent emergency room visit to give one star. While visiting Boston for a doctors appointment and leisure activities my son had an autism meltdown requiring an ambulance ride to MGH ER, at, when upon arrival, arrived completely calm and responsive. Our wait time to see a medical doctor was quick, and a cursory examination was done to medically clear my son. I thought we were getting discharged, but my 11 year old son was then transferred to a psychiatric area with adults. I explained to the nursing staff that the ""special psychiatric"" locked rooms would cause an increase in his anxiety, and since he was calm and relaxed we didn't need to be there. My request was ignored. We arrived at 5pm. We were examined by a female fellow with very limited knowledge on autism. Protocol at other hospitals we have been to have followed current recommendations in that those diagnosed with autism thrive better in their own environments. She decided to make him stay the night. I asked for a room that wasn't a ""locked"" room, one that had a chair for me, and that my son needed supper. They said no chair, and they couldn't help with dinner. My son remained calm and baseline the entire evening. Throughout the night I filmed my son so I could text his father, who was very worried. At 11:00pm, I was approached by head of security who explained that I could not use my phone to take pictures for HIPPA reasons, and that she would need to see all the pictures on my phone. I explained that my pictures were for his father, and that all pictures taken were done from the privacy of our locked room. I further explained that the three receptionists were ""snap chatting"" on their phones for a period of about 20 minutes in the public area, which I think would me more of a HIPPA concern. The unfortunate side of security pulling me away from my son needlessly was that he was terrified when I left the room, had an anxiety attack, requiring a shot of Haldol to relax him. For sleeping arrangements my son was on a narrow stretcher, and I sat at the end. The following morning we were evaluated by extremely knowledgable staff who discharged us immediately and apologized on behalf of their colleagues for having us stay needlessly. They were the polite, courteous and genuinely sweet. Upon discharge I asked for a shower for my son as he wet the bed and they said it wasn't possible. We left the hospital at 11:00am, for the 2 hour ride home with a wet son, who still hadn't eaten from the day before. If you need an emergency room for your child with autism, do not go to MGH. While their autism clinic in Lexington is top notch, their knowledge hasn't transferred to their Emergency room at their main campus. For a hospital with such amazing accolades I find it unacceptable. Without a doubt if my son had a brain tumor, or diabetes for sure our treatment would have been better, we would have been offered food, better sleeping accommodations, better access to medical staff, and I'm sure a shower. My son was not treated like a child with complex medical needs, he was treated like he was a bother. Do not choose this emergency room for autism spectrum disorder."
164	Franck Dernoncourt	1	"A 15 USD fee to get an electronic copy of my x-ray or MRI is not something I enjoy. Data should belong to patients. Do you still live in the 19th century?

Also, just a warning for anyone going there for a surgery: some MGH surgeons practice concurrent surgeries (this means that your surgeon may operate several patients at once). Google ""Concurrent surgeries at Mass General caught in crosshairs of new lawsuit"" for more information. MGH claims that ""Data from the MGH as well as national studies have demonstrated no difference in complication rates for overlapping and non-overlapping cases."" but that's false, e.g. see the study ""Ravi, Bheeshma, Daniel Pincus, David Wasserstein, Anand Govindarajan, Anjie Huang, Peter C. Austin, Richard Jenkinson, Patrick DG Henry, J. Michael Paterson, and Hans J. Kreder. ""Association of overlapping surgery with increased risk for complications following hip surgery: a population-based, matched cohort study."" JAMA Internal Medicine (2017)."""

166	Brenda Simpson	3	"I have a problem when your child come into the hospital stay i. Emergency room overnight no room but gets admitted then squeezed in the next day at 11 am to 7th floor treated fine the first night and the remaining of current stay she has to contact the nurse for her scedule pain medicine and then she or he comes into the like you are causing them a problem but you work everyday and your insurance is paying fot them to have a job
This professional nurse career. Had gone down the tube are we that greedy for money till we forget the human part of it something's need to changed"
167	Brian St. Germain	5	Thank god for Mass General.  We are very fortunate to live so close.
168	Bayoan Martinez-Yung	5	Dr. Benz usually works on this hospital. I got an injured foot when I get off on the Green Line from the “E” train 🚂 at Riverway when I was walking to Brookline to the toy store, then the “D” train 🚂 to Chestnut Hill to have Shake Shack for my lunch.
169	Grace Lee	5	it's a pretty dank hospital
170	Deborah Horner-Richardson	5	We live near Dartmouth Hitchocock Medical Center - teaching hospital for Dartmouth Medical School, but they cannot hold a candle to MGH.  Docs at MGH do a much better job of diagnosing illnesses (in my case and for many friends, as well) and they have a level of professionalism I have never seen anywhere else.  I can see why people come from all over the world to be treated here.  After two years of treatment for a rare head and neck cancer, I would not go anywhere else.  The three hour drive every eight weeks is easily worth the care I receive at MGH.
171	Tak Mok	5	Best hospital on the East Coast great place with great doctors
172	Miguel Angel C. Gallardo	5	"Gracias doctor David Furcione

175	Tony Cappotto	5	Im here for an emergency splienectomy and from emergency to ICU to stable.The most courteous and proffessional staff ive come across.
176	Tom Roller	2	"Hit or miss, full of arrogant doctors/students/nurses (some really really bad) with no one to answer to it seems; though some excellent doctors and some excellent nurses (we had mostly OK). Wife had brain tumor met from breast cancer; some exc nurses, some don't care a bit about the pain or discomfort; doctors come in, do the same tests 5x in a day; lo and behold, most charged and big money at that. 5 min for 750.00 in a couple of cases and only share information if asked, and some very begrudgingly at that. The worst was one appt the doctor walked out on wife while she was almost in a seizure, (we were in because she was having seizures) never came back cause she was through with wife not wanting to take any more keppra because of the way it made her feel (I waited 10 minutes, wife calmed down, dr never came back or checked on her though I told her ""watch, here it (the seizure) comes...""). And we are not rude people or disrespectful to anyone that we know of.
One dr cut out an eyepatch and put it on her (she was cross-eyed from the tumor) and said"" there, now I really made you look stupid..."" Be prepared for lots of behind the walls/doors laughter at the radiation room; students and nurses have a lot of fun there I guess...LOUDLY. Real appropriate for sick people. Really liked our radiation oncologist though he had the rudest nurse perhaps I have ever talked to on the phone or in office anywhere.
Check-in in over-crowded room downstairs before brain shunt for surgery - haitian nurse literally makes fun of man (very sick) who, when she mispronounced his name, he corrected her nicely - she glared him down and childishly repeated his name loudly in mimicry while rolling her eyes. I was do disgusted. He was sick, disfigured, and found it hard to stand up. Shame on the managers of MGH. It is a human zoo full of the best equipment you'll find, but hit or miss when it comes to doctors or help."
177	Susan Jones	5	Used there Brain Surgery Staff amazing  not to mention the nurses in icu blake unit I was in icu for a week because it was during the flu so there was no rooms everyone we meet was awesome if i didnt leave so far away i would change all my doctors down there.

And very expensive 500 $ just to see doctor with out medicine

Tip No If you are looking for a medicine, do not go to the commercial hospital

Just open the file for $ 500 and wait for an hour and two to two hours for Dr.

If completed, just ring, then opens. We had the lecture hall completely to ourselves. I was thrilled, the children had (unfortunately / understandably) only a limited interest.
I can not judge the quality of the medical care, because I did not get treated.

(Nachträgliche Rezension für Juli 2015) Aus beruflichem Interesse habe ich den Ether Dome besichtigt. Nicht ganz leicht zu finden, aber kostenloser Zugang. Falls abgeschlossen, einfach klingeln, wird dann geöffnet. Wir hatten den Hörsaal ganz für uns allein. Ich war begeistert, die Kinder hatten (leider/verständlicherweise) nur ein eingeschränktes Interesse.
Die Qualität der medizinischen Betreuung kann ich nicht beurteilen, da ich mich nicht habe behandeln lassen."
