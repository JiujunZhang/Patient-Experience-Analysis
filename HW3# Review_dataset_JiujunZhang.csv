Clayton H.,"Honolulu, HI",5,2/27/20,"AHI POKE AND SPICY TUNA LOVERS ATTENTION Some shoppers mention lack of parking, and stalls are tight. Actually there's lots more parking under the store and  if your not looking for it, it's easy to miss.However that being said. This is the only Costco that I know of in Massachusetts that can make a killer Ahi Poke  and Spicy Tuna. And that's saying a lot considering I lived in Hawaii my entire life ""Poke Capital""The down side of this, it's only offered 8 times a year.So poke lovers look for the big sign just above the meats in the meat section. That reads SEAFOOD ROADSHOW and dates will be posted.You won't be disappointed that's a guarantee"
Keiko A.,"大井, Shinagawa, Japan",2,9/23/20,"Shopping carts were not clean at all.  Please clean them well.  Inside was dirty.  I don't hate Costco, but I hope they clean the carts (inside and outside) and inside of store better."
Rachel F.,"Waltham, MA",1,9/28/20,Absolutely the rudest associates and managers ever encountered. Love being treated like a criminal over a membership card.
Nikolai K.,"Waltham, MA",4,2/2/20,"Solid Costco. If you're reading this review I'm assuming you're considering going to this one, if you have a membership you've been to a Costco before so you know how it works. Nothing unusual here.We come here almost every weekend for errands, groceries, etc. Got our tires serviced here a few times at the tire center. Never had any bad experiences here. Employees and customer service people are all nice.Pros compared to other Costcos: this one has a covered parking garage.Cons compared to other Costcos: a little on the smaller side but not by much, also there's no Costco gas (but in the northeast this is a bit rare to begin with)."
Lora F.,"Sarasota, FL",1,7/23/20,"Since when have Employees at Costco been giving permission to be so RUDE?!In there today.. dropped 400 plus.. asked for a box for my items.. was told "" they are over there.  Get them yourself"" ?! Are Fn Kidding me?!Like we dont have  enough to deal with?!..being hurded like sheep to what ever line they force you to, plexiglass,  spraying  sanitizing crap all over me while i loaded my items! And.. And on my way out.. the guy at the door LITERALLY grabbed the receipt out of hand, so aggressively and pushed my hand away, with such disdain. Time to cancel my membership. It used to be so cool to shop there  with great value and unusual items.  Not now.. same crap as Walmarts! Later Costco!"
Paul Z.,"Belmont, MA",3,2/7/20,It's a fine Costco but the parking lot is terrible. The spots are too small and there is not enough room between the rows. It can take ten minutes to get in and out most times. The store itself is good. They have wine beer and liquor which is nice.
Christopher G.,"Hanscom Air Force Base, MA",4,3/9/19,"I am definitely a long-time fan of Costco!!  Most of everything you need can be most here.  From rotisserie chicken, spinach artichoke dip, fresh bakery items, storage bins, baby wipes, even alcohol... it's mostly here.  However, this particular Costco is smaller than those I am used to in Michigan, with less produce/products/merchandise available.  One of my favorite items (bacon-wrapped scallops) is not sold here, yet was always available in Michigan??  But I digress.There is no gas station at this location, which is a big loss to consumers."
James S.,"Warrendale, Waltham, MA",5,4/20/19,"I really like Costco for bulk food shopping at a great price.  The employees seem to stay for long periods of time which tells me they treat the employees well.  The store is well kept and clean and the food quality is very good.I also like the optical department, tires, liquor store and food court.I love the hot dog and soda for $1.50I always ask for sauerkraut and then put fresh diced onions, deli mustard and relish.OMG, soooooo good!I also often get the whole pizza.Extra large Cheese, pepperoni or everything for $9.95 each.Overall, Costco is a great place to shop!!"
Esss E.,"Cambridge, MA",1,2/9/20,Costco Hearing Aid Center pulled through. Excellent service especially from audiologist Elizabeth.
Xin C.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,1/9/20,"[Complaint against Membership employee Jaz] Okay I have always liked Costco but today at Waltham Costco this membership person named Jaz had really bad attitude. I don't know if she's always like this or just was in a really bad mood. I wanted to use a membership certificate I recently bought on Costco's online partner that offers you $10 cash card for membership. When at the desk with Jaz, she says you can't get this $10 cash card because it requires your prior membership to have expired for 18 months. That is indeed a requirement buried in super tiny font in the very end of the certificate that I didn't know. (on sites like Groupon for things like this they will warn you of these restrictions very clearly, terrible certificate :/) But anyway this is not her faulty. Then I asked her to check if there are ways to establish a new account since I moved to a new place, she's very annoyed and says there's no way since my name and DOB matched with my old account. I'm okay not getting this cash card, it's her attitude and her ash-colored and stiff face that really bothered me. At one point she even said ""you inactived your membership 5 month ago for reasons I will not ask..."" I was like, what are you suggesting? That I canceled in the past so that I can take advantage of the signup now? For A) I CAN! for B) I moved to a town without Costco five months ago, of course I needed to cancel it. DON'T ASSUME THINGS AND SAY IT WITH A BAD ATTITUDE JAZ!I called and complained to her supervisor after I left, I hope this will be addressed."
A Hip Single M.,"Roslindale, MA",1,9/11/19,"Costco Tire: Waste of time experience! Ordered tires (not a cheap set either) on a Friday. Was told they would be sent overnight and if I wanted a Saturday appointment. I said I would set an appointment up for Sunday in case the tires came late in the day. Showed up on Sunday afternoon only to be told my tires hadn't arrived. The guy didn't seem to understand why I would have set an appointment up (because your associate wanted me to come on Saturday!). Was told I would get a call by 4pm Monday with an update. No call. I called 3x between 4-8 with no answer. Drove over there only to find out that my tires were there but too late to install. I set up an appointment for the next day. I get my tires installed. I then notice my TPMS is out of wack. They must have never reset it. I went back and they act like nothing is wrong and to take it to the dealership. Horrible experience and quite a bit of cash put down. I should have cancelled my order on Sunday when the tires weren't in and took my business else where. Every employee I spoke too was very rude, all the while I kept my cool even when I had every right not to. Horrible customer service. ZERO STARS"
Asta S.,"Boston, MA",3,11/24/19,"I believed that Costco was a good place to work and that they value their employees. However, when I went to purchase a membership, I was given such a hard sell about upgrading to their executive program that I am rethinking all that I know about the company and what they make their employees do. For the exec membership to pay off, you need to spend $230 a month or about $3,000 a year, which is a lot. In addition, they tried to get my credit card on file so it could auto-renew, but I refused. Consumer beware."
Christine B.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",5,8/2/18,"Costco, you are a magical place!!  This is your place to get things in BULK for insanely CHEAP prices. $3.99 for 2 POUNDS of strawberries? $2.99 for a pack of 40 water bottles? That's it, game over-- this place already won my heart. You can literally find everything you need (and things you didn't know you needed):  snacks, meat and seafood, frozen foods, home necessities, clothes, books,  medications, appliances--you name it. This can be your one-stop place for everything you need to survive. And the best part is you save time and money because buying everything in large quantity will last you a while before you need another trip to the store.Also another equally great part of Costco is their food court!! You can't come here and NOT stop by to get something off the menu. They sell pizza, churros, salads, sausages, hotdogs, non-fat yogurt shakes, and so much more. And in true Costco fashion, everything is super cheap. I got a hotdog and a refillable drink all for just $1.50.  I bet you can't name anything better that you can get for that price. Perfect for a pre-or post-shopping snack/meal!"
Marie K.,"New York, NY",5,8/31/18,"Costco is not just a store but rather a way of life. Kirkland brand products are of high quality, especially considering the comparison to other big box stores' branding.Food is amazing, and there are always free samples. Staff are all helpful.Fair prices for all and everything by the dozen!"
BostonBestEats X.,"Boston, MA",4,11/22/17,"COSTCO LIQUOR SHOP IN WALTHAMOne of the few Costco-owned liquor shops in MA.  Ownership of multiple liquor stores is limited by MA law, so some Costco's have outside vendors who actually own the liquor shops at Costco, and so the prices are not as good.This is one of the exceptions that Costco actually owns, and supposedly their 2nd biggest shop in sales in the US.  And Costco is the biggest wine buyer in the US.  So you can usually count on as much as ~25% off of the very best price in MA for a particular wine/beer/liquor.  In fact, I've saved as much as 50% off when I was lucky to get the last bottles of something after they marked it down to make room for new stock (look in the bottom of the bins!).Unfortunately, the wine buyer who was there before 2010 or so left and his replacement(s) doesn't seem to be very serious about getting in anything unusual.  You used to be able to get some interesting stuff here, like newly released classified Bordeaux, or a case of the legendary 1997 Sam Adams Triple Bock.  There was even an email list alerting his best customers to limited availability items.  Not anymore.I had to laugh today when they appeared to think they were selling the 99 point Wine Spectator 2014 Wine of the Year (usually priced at $220) for $16.99.  It was actually a lesser 90 point bottling, but still a good price for what it was (pic).So if you are looking for big name, big production items at great prices, this a good place to come.  But it doesn't replace Gordon's, Marty's, ect. if you are serious about wine."
App T.,"Boston, MA",5,9/16/18,"Acai Bowl - Costco Food CourtGreat news for us Costco has recently introduced an ""Acai Bowl"" which looks very tempting. It is like a snack or dessert which can go well anytime especially during summer. Very delicious and a combination of blueberries, strawberries with acai makes it delightful and crunchy granola works very well in this combination. It tastes like ice-cream.  I loved it. Price of this bowl is $5."
Sharon A.,"Boston, MA",1,3/11/19,"My review is for customer relations only. Had to do the shopping as my husband who typically does all this kind of heavy lifting shopping is just out of the hospital on crutches for the next 2 months.They would NOT be humane and let me buy. I spent more than an hour filling a cart for our family only to be stone heart denied.Now I know it's ""against policy"" but man, yow! Humanity, kindness, something slightly out of the box?!?"
P L.,"Boston, MA",2,7/29/19,I want to get a membership and have a question. No one will answer the phone! I was so desperate to speak with someone that I actually called the pharmacy and she transferred me and still no one answered! Why do they have a phone number if no one picks up? Arrggghhhh.
Jeremy S.,"Watertown, MA",5,8/8/18,It's a Costco: five stars.The alcohol section was new for me and I was really impressed with it. The prices on the kirkland signature branded products were amazing and the quality was indistinguishable from items costing 50% more.
璐妍,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",4,8/6/18,"A must-go supermarket in the USA.We headed for each Costco in almost every cities we travelled.All the groceries,appliances,food,supplies you are looking to you can find them here.After a shopping for meals,I found the fruit smoothie really delicious,with several kinds of berries.although a little bit sour,I really appreciate it."
Olivia W.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/5/19,"i went there on sunday and they had such good samples. My family, at home, sometimes has sausage and it's so good and on sunday they had sausage that tasted just like it. My favorate cheese is parmesan and they had a cheese sample and it tasted just like that cheese. On that day we got lamb chops and we ate them yesterday and they were great!! Even if i  am not getting that product, they have a huge product that i just like to stare and stare at it. The huge product i am talking about is the mini playground in the middle of the store. Finally, the food in there medium sized food court is really good. i love there hot dogs. There hot dogs juicy and good. That's why i think Costco is a great place to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Melissa L.,"Boston, MA",5,9/17/17,"Great place to stack up on bundles of produce and food for a much cheaper price. One of my favorite things about shopping here is that I know once I buy what I need I won't have to return for another 3 weeks because of the amount it brings. For example buying a pack of Dove soap cost me 14.99$ for 16 bars. Or buying a jug of Palmolive dish soap for 7.99$ that brings 90 fl oz in comparison to the small one you can buy at your local market that only brings 10 fl oz. Also keep in mind these are not set prices, they have discounts all the time on popular items including food and if you happen to find a coupon you can also use that too!My favorite of them all has to be buying a 40 pack of water for only 2.99$ where else can you find an amazing deal like that? The list for discounts goes on and on...Note: they give free samples for food on the weekends and there is plenty! Also you'll find the best churros (which are also big) for 1$The membership is worth it, in the end you will be saving much more than you typically spend! I'm a regular here and always come back finding great deals."
Ray B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,11/21/18,Used to buy tons of things there and had an executive card.Stopped for a bit as they were changing products and I found BJs a bit more expensive but better quality.I went back to Costco about a year ago and then they started ONLY taking Visa or Cash so I'm done it's not my CC of choice and I find the store near me in Waltham to be too full of very inconsiderate customers. It's a hassle I don't need
Jeff B.,"Newton, MA",4,9/8/18,"You have to kind of take the good with the bad when it comes to this Costco. The benefits of being a member at Costco are pretty well known on a national scale. If there are products that you use regularly, and on a bulk level, you'll save a good amount of money buying it from a club like Costco. In Massachusetts your two choices are basically Costco or BJ's. In my case I find BJ's to be more conveniently located and easier to get in and out of, but it seems like 90% of the time Costco's prices are either identical or better than BJ's.Costco has a great selection of meat, tender & flavorful rotisserie chickens and great med prices. On the downside, it seems like it's really long past time that they opened up more locations in Massachusetts. The Waltham store is always packed and the crazy parking lot is the introduction greeting you to that reality. There's been a time or two where the checkout lines are so long that if I can buy it elsewhere or wait another day or two I'll just avoid shopping there all together that day.I was teetering between giving them a three or a four star rating. I'm going with a four only because I have to issue the brunt of my rating on the basis of how this store performs individually and the products that they're selling. The fact that they don't get a five is more a knock on corporate for not expanding their presence in Massachusetts and fostering an unnecessarily overcrowded and occasionally unpleasant shopping experience."
Amanda C.,"Westborough, MA",1,2/3/19,Rude employees. Just had an argument with a cashier named Peng. I have been a member for years and this will be my last year. Will never renew my membership after this year after the exchange I just had with this very rude employee. Not worth the $60 membership.
Roger M.,"Waltham, MA",5,2/17/15,"What is there to say, Costco is great and I go there all of the time.  It is significantly better than BJs in terms of quality.  (Although BJs has better variety and a deli counter.)  The biggest problem is that you run in for a small item and land up spending $100 because there is always something else you need.  (Is that their secret?)It would be easy to discuss the pre-packaged items.  That is simply comparing brands and prices.  So, I will skip that topic.I buy a lot of fresh seafood and fruit at this store.  That is not what I would have expected from a warehouse club because I am a stickler for quality.  But, I think their business model makes things fresh.  This is what I believe:At a supermarket chain, the food comes in to a central warehouse.  It is unloaded and sorted.  (Perhaps a day goes by.)  It then gets loaded on a delivery truck to a specific store.  It then gets unloaded, sorted and put on shelves.  (Another day.)At this Costco, I have seen fruit delivered.  The palettes come off the truck and are delivered directly to the store floor.  Therefore, it is two days fresher and with less bruises.  You just need to eat a lot of berries.The seafood is also amazingly fresh.  As a New Englander, you would think that I would insist on the local market.  But, I am beginning to think that the fist is fresher here.  There is just a more limited variety and you need to buy a huge portion.  Still, if you don't mind cooking salmon one day and then having it for lunch on the next two days, it is really good.I also use their other services.  For example, the prescription eye glasses are less than half the price of my previous optometrist and the quality is excellent.Just go."
Sarina D.,"Smithfield, RI",1,12/17/18,Actually the fucking dumbest fucking store because you can't buy a gift card for someone who ALWAYS shops here because you don't have a costco membership.... SO if you do have a membership you can only buy a gift card for either yourself or someone else who has one. Let me just wrap my head around this idiotic business strategy
Deirdre C.,"Danville, NH",4,9/2/14,"We are longtime Costco members, since the 90s. Did I just age myself?? I wish there were more in NH, the only one being in Nashua. This one in Waltham is a pretty typical Costco, except for the underground parking garage, which is also where the tire installation services are. Building seems bigger than most from the outside, probably because it has two levels of what I presume is office space above the warehouse. Inside, no surprises.Little hectic as it was near lunchtime so everyone was clustered around the assorted sample carts that had set up a short time earlier. I was getting hungry too and got a tray of turkey and Swiss rollers (cut up wraps). Quite tasty though a bit too much mayo for my liking. Minor detail. I like getting the two dozen pack of organic eggs for $6.99. Better price per dozen than at the grocery store by far.  The Kirkland Signature cashew clusters (snacks aisle) are very good. And they have a nice assortment of dog beds in different sizes and styles. We always buy the KS toilet paper and paper towels. Have compared to self branded products at BJs and Sam's Club; Costco always beats them in price and quality. I remember seeing a documentary about a Costco lab lady who does tensile strength and loft testing on the tp! Can I get that job?? ;)The KS button down dress shirts are very good quality. They come out with new colors and patterns frequently. Thankfully now they're displayed in small cut away boxes, by size, making it much easier to find what you're looking for than when they were piled on tables. Though most of the other clothes are still done that way.They could seriously consider putting in more cart return corrals in the distant parts of the main parking lot. Bit of a hike on a very hot day to walk halfway back to the warehouse. I refuse to be one of  those who leaves their cart out in the open and let it roll into someone's car. Pet peeve... All in all I won't mind stopping into this one again when I'm in the area."
Kristine V.,"Cambridge, MA",1,7/6/17,"Great store but one of the women in membership services is so aggressive she actually turns customers away rather than bringing them in. Shocking, Costco.  And a shame.  She was working the afternoon of July 6.  I wish I had asked her name so that I could post it here.  A liability rather than an asset!!!!"
Emily B.,"Auburndale, MA",2,7/20/17,"The people at the membership register are overly aggressive. I get they need to upsell, but the woman did everything except sign my name on the line to upgrade me to the premium membership (which I don't need at all. I'm a single person that only goes to the store here and there for certain items). Other than that, inventory is well stocked and most associates are friendly. There was one cashier that yelled at me for cutting a guy in line when in reality he said I could go in front of him since I only had 2 things. I love Costco in general so I'll keep coming here, but maybe their staff needs some more training."
Daniel G.,"Burlington, MA",1,11/18/18,"Incredibly rude employees.  For the money my family spends here, its disappointing that lack of customer service makes an already stressful shopping experience unbearable.  I returned my groceries and clothing.  I'll spend my hard earned $500 elsewhere."
Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",4,10/21/16,"I am a Costco fan. This location is old and cramped compared to the one in Everett where I usually go. The great advantage at the Waltham location is that they carry my favorite cheese: Petite Basque. This cheese seems to sell close to Lincoln and Weston but not in Everett. In the last 10 years, Everett carried the cheese once."
Navya C.,"Fremont, CA",5,4/26/15,They have the best and polite customer service i have ever seen.I had once even returned an open yoghurt box which had gone badI go there every weekend and Costco never disappoints me. The prices on the whole sale are very reasonable . This is the trip i always look forward to since i get to spend some quality time with my busy boyfriend.
Mary H.,"Allston/Brighton, Boston, MA",5,9/3/17,Edit: this location renovated their hot food section. It looks pretty much the same but their menu now includes not just the vanilla yogurt but also the chocolate and swirl yogurts!!! *squealing in glee* Had to get a creamy swirl yogurt. I love their chicken bakes too!!!! No where can beat the prices they have.
Deborah C.,"Arlington, MA",1,6/2/15,"Costco used to be a great place, but everything I have bought this year I have ended up returning because the product was inferior. Jeans, a piece of jewelry, and an HP printer,  which are normally good. Then I looked it up on Amazon before opening and it was one of their worst lemons. Not only that, the people on the Amazon reviews all bought it from Costco.They used to have that fresh shellfish kiosk which was a big hit then they took it away in favor of all prepackaged stuff. Their meats have definitely gone down a grade, and the fruit is the only bargain left. The prepackaged food is JUNK and I know my stuff in that department.Even my new eyeglass lenses do not seem right-not renewing anymore Costco!"
Julie C.,"Newton, MA",1,12/30/17,"My family and I have always been long time Costco members and we always get our tiers there, however today when we went to the Costco's in Waltham they were all out of the tire I needed for my car so they told us the Costco's in Avon had them and we headed there. Long story short we went to the Avon location and asked for the four tiers to be replaced along with the valves. The gentleman helping us even showed us a diagram of the valves they would be replacing. We come back an hour and a half later when they called us and my father-in-law who was with me at the time, looked the car over and noticed that the valves were not replaced. He was in the automotive business for years and spotted this right away. He went back in and asked for a refund, they then told him they would put in aftermarket valves and he told them no. He asked for a refund and to talk to the manager. He did that and told them that they should be ashamed of themselves because most people would not have caught that mistake and that they are essentially pulling stuff over their customers and lying. They told us that it was an honest mistake but we it did not sit right with us so we decided to post this review and tell everyone that we were not happy with the service and to also be aware of them lying to you about what they really are doing when they replaced you tiers. Won't be going back there."
Monica M.,"Woburn, MA",1,4/30/15,"This place is terrible and more expensive than BJ's wholesale. I was just there and needed a few products they advertise as available and I couldn't find them anywhere! One employee was very nice and tried to help me, but when he radioed others for help, they told him ""they couldn't help at the moment"" and they ""guessed"" they just didn't have the products. To just tell me that they didn't that've them. The lady in the bakery couldn't answer if they carried gluten-free rolls, the guy up front said that he would help me if I got him THEIR product numbers. I mean, really? He was willing to help only, and only IF, I did half the work for him!!! He finally looked things up for me because I got him the product numbers... That's the beauty of smart phones as smart people, meaning, me ;-)I couldn't find over half the things they advertise they have! They were all more expensive than advertised also.Oh, and I guess they don't take credit?!?!?! What, banks/CC companies don't trust them?? Or their customers??? WTF kind of crap is that?!?! How do they not take VISA??? It's just so bizarre in there.The customers are bizarre too. Sorry, the people just seems too weird, lolThe guy in the cash register was VERY rude when I told him I was trying to use credit. I prefer credit as it's easier to fix if my CC gets hacked vs debit. Oh, and I should say that I was using my office's Costco membership card. I WOULD NEVER pay this company to shop at such pathetic stores!Can you tell I'm disgusted at this place? GOOD, because I am!"
Erika K.,"Waltham, MA",2,2/2/17,I've been a member here for a few years.  This place is always ridiculously crowded on weekends. They never have all the register lines open even with huge lines.  I was looking for batteries for my moms hearing aid and trying to see if someone could help me but was completely ignored by the people working that department who were pretending not to see me by being so busy with what they were doing. I ended up calling and woman in the hearing aid department was pretty rude.  Not very friendly staff.
Thida P.,"Boston, MA",3,2/26/16,"I used to come here quite often years ago when I lived in the area. My parents come here all the time. They were here last weekend and bought a few things, and when they got home they realized they forgot an item in the cart. So they hurried back to the store to see if the item was in the cart, and unfortunately it wasn't. So they went to the customer service counter, and customer service wasn't able to help them so they were sent to the managers. Manager station is located right by the liquers. Supervisors were not able to help and told them to come back the next day to see if anyone had turn it in. Well the next day was Monday and they didn't have time to go back until Friday. So since I was in town visiting my parents, I decided to go with my mom to Costco. Once again she went to the customer service desk and explained her story to the older man working. For almost two minutes he completely ignored us. He started taping together two bottles of vitamin as we were waiting there. Finally he reaches down to get the lost and found book. Asked my mom again what day she forgot the item. He looked it up and saw nothing. He then sent us to the managers again... There were a few people standing by the manager's area and my mom once again explained her story, but she didn't have her receipt with her to prove she actually bought the item.  At first it seemed like they didn't want to help but the woman, I guess a supervisor, said to another supervisor (a guy) to look up my mom's card, and the guy said he didn''t know how. Maybe he was new?  The woman supervisor had to show the guy how to look up people's receipt. They looked it up and they do see that the item was  purchased. The woman told my mom they will replace it. So thank you for that. It just sucked that they couldn't help my parents the first time around and my mom had to go back another day."
Harry H.,"Yarmouth, ME",2,6/12/16,"Telephone call on Saturday morning:""Hi, do you have ice cream cakes?""The answer:""Call back in 10 minutes, I don't speak English"""
D Y.,"Boston, MA",3,3/18/17,"This review is for this specific Waltham Costco--we go to several and overall love Costco as a business.This is an unusual Costco.  First, there is underground parking--probably because this Costco has less land compared to other Costcos with more ground-level parking.  Although this may be nice for some people who would prefer to avoid rain & snow, you generally end up walking longer than at most Costcos because of the long ramp.  I also try to avoid parking in the lower level part which is immediately to your left when you turn in because you either need to carry your purchased items down the stairs or steer your shopping cart the long way around.There are lots of samples on weekends, but as other people have said, this one is particularly crowded, and lines at checkout tend to be longer than average for other Costcos.  The congestion makes it tedious to both walk past these long lines when you're shopping and when you're trying to get to a certain checkout lane.  This Costco doesn't have self-checkout, which makes it less convenient than some other Costcos if you prefer to scan your own items.  This Costco's layout is atypical--for example, chips are normally in the back right of the other Costcos in the area, but here they're in the back left near dairy/frozen.  This one doesn't have some items that are found at most other Costcos in the area, but they conversely have many unique items, especially Asian items.Unfortunately this is the only Costco where I've had multiple unpleasant experiences with a specific employee--Louise--who works at returns/membership and tends to have short colored hair."
Matt F.,"Wayland, MA",2,10/30/16,"After years of running the store you think they learn that they always have L and XL and XXL leftover. They always run out of S and M quickly. Then they have the giant sizes left for months. Hello!?  This isn't Texas. This is New England. When will they order the right amount of the right sizes. And some things we just want a reasonable amount of because not everyone here has a family of eight or run a business. Especially perishables like cheese. Can't you package them in normal quantities?  I mean coffee, toilet paper, or dry goods is fine but the other stuff just make a smaller package. But despite my low rating which is out of frustration I remain a loyal customer and have been for years."
J K.,"Henderson, NV",5,9/29/17,This is specifically for their tire center.  I had such great service from Joe.  I seriously have never had this kind of service!!  I highly recommend the tire center.  The employees here are amazing!!
Mag B.,"Scituate, MA",3,1/6/17,"Their cafe always seems overwhelmed.  Granted, you don't necessarily go to Costco for the cafe, but it's frustrating to walk in assuming you can get something before you leave... and then finding the cafe so slow that you walk out hungry.Might be better for you anyway, I guess."
Patricia G.,"Arlington, VA",4,7/31/17,"Stopped in during my visit with relatives in Waltham and was glad to see the variety of cheeses that this location offered.  Coming from the D.C. area that has one of the largest Costco's in the country, I was afraid that this location was not going to offer a lot of choice, but happy to say that while the store was certainly much smaller in size the variety was still there.  Like all Costco's the lines are always long and cashier service is less than friendly."
David K.,"Lexington, MA",4,7/27/16,Pretty normal Cosco - probably on the smaller side but has cosco food and most services
Natasha H.,"Melrose, MA",5,6/11/13,"When I started working near this Costco, I thought it would be a convenient place to get giant TP and laundry detergent. However, Costco has far exceeded my expectations and it is definitely worth the membership. The prices are great, but so is the quality and selection of their products. Yes, I get the giant tubs of Tide and Cascade and mayo- sadly, they do not carry the Cottonelle that is required for our pampered behinds - but also far more fresh food than I have expected. Highlights: - Empire kosher chicken, both whole and in pieces - the best tasting chicken out there and way cheaper than anywhere else- Pete's Major Dickenson blend whole bean coffee- Seaweed salad, Sabra's hummus- Same raspberries, blueberries etc.. that you get at a regular supermarket but at like a third the price. The bakery looks pretty good but I avoid that. They are also great for buying seasonal items for the garden for example.Lastly, the best thing about this location is the liquor section. The selection is limited compared to a typical booze store, but they have some great wines for awesome prices. The only pain is that they do not take credit cards except for their own."
Jessica K.,"Lincoln, MA",4,11/14/13,"I am a mother of three, so I rely on Costco for quite a few things. The milk is much cheaper than at the grocery store and we are drinking about a gallon a day.The meats/fish and produce are a great addition along with the staples. I don't do all my shopping there, but I am there at least once a week.I recommend if you want to avoid the crazy lines and weekends, to try a Monday night or possibly any week night. I can be in and out of there in 20 min!The staff is usually really helpful and fast. If you don't have your receipt, they will refund you in the form of a gift card. They are not really difficult when it comes to returns."
Leo F.,"Arlington, MA",4,6/24/14,"We visit this Costco fairly often and have yet to be disappointed.  I've even tried their cafe once (hotdog combo, BBQ sandwich, salad).  The products are diverse and are sometimes updated.  It's quite easy to spend more than a $100 on a single trip here.We've always parked in the parking garage under the store as the above ground parking lot always looked crowded.  I'm sometimes intimidated by the long lines for checkout but have since discovered that the lines can move pretty quickly such that 15 minutes later, there are no lines.  As for the crowds within the store, I've seen much worst at another Costco."
Matthew L.,"Boston, MA",4,1/26/10,"This location is quite larger then most Costco's and even has an under the building garage. The problem is the location is not ideal and is a bit difficult to get to seeing Winter street has had major construction going on for a while. The parking here is also a bit strange since the parking lot is narrow and pretty far away from the entrance which is tucked in the corner of the building. The inside is like any other Costco, but seems to have more of a selection and a lot more cashiers to check you out. They were the only Costco that had a liquor store but now it seems like every location has added this feature."
Allison M.,"Waltham, MA",4,1/18/16,"My parents are members of another branch and I used to go with them as a kid / they'd send me for stuff in high school. I signed up for the $55 a year membership and it's so worth it. I mostly go for the stuff I'd need in bulk, like toilet paper, paper towels, coffee and miscellaneous stuff. Great bakery and prepared food sections, especially if you're hosting a party. This location can be a little nuts on the weekend, but it's spacious and well organized. Love Costco!"
Pam S.,"Upland, CA",5,9/7/10,"Went here this past Saturday I had to order Deli trays for my Moms funeral. =/ They were very understanding and moved HEAVEN & EARTH to get my order in (my own fault) late on Friday FOR SHAME I am in food & beverage I outta know better. They were so capable and helpful to me the Deli Manager Diane rushed my order... I was coming to pick it up on Saturday by 10:00am.It's not the closest location to Boston but I can say the Assorted Croissant Trays were lovely to behold, the Meat and Cheese Tray were done very nicely as well and the Turkey Wraps (sliced pinwheel style) were quite popular at the repast. The cashiers were friendly and helpful and in light of the fact that I was using my Ex-husband Costco card (hehehehehe) that had expired they didn't give me any hassle at the registar just approved it through at the spot. BTW everything was fresh at this location the breads smelled delicious and so did the cakes. Clean aisles it was quite hard to find on google maps so my suggestion is to get the directions off of their phone line.Respectfully Reviewed"
Juan F.,"Monterey Park, CA",5,7/19/12,"Best Costco I've been to! They have so many free samples every time I come (whether weekday or weekend)!! Yes, sometimes I come for samples only to replace a meal. I know some Costcos only have tons of samples on weekends... but not this one! The store is really clean and organized as well. Food is cheap which is what I come here for. Almost always get the Rotisserie Chicken. Its about $5 for 4 lbs so definitely a bargain. I get my contact lenses and glasses here too. People working at the optometry are really nice and friendly."
joanna b.,"Wellesley, MA",5,12/16/14,"Yesterday was my second time shopping at Costco after being a loyal BJs customer for over ten years. After my wonderful experience at Costco, I know I will always do my shopping there! When I realized I'd dropped my coupon somewhere in the store while shopping with my kids, Chris at the check out counter helped me search for it, and made sure the discount was applied, even when we were unable to locate it. His warm nature changed what could've been a stressful situation for a new customer shopping with kids into a wonderful experience that shows Costo's commitment to its customers. I love that when Chris helped us out to the car after and I thanked him profusely, he just said with a smile, ""No problem, it's all part of the Costco experience."" Im glad that Costco hires people like Chris to make our shopping experience above and beyond our expectations."
Jessica S.,"Framingham, MA",2,1/30/13,"By far the WORST Costco I've ever been to. As my boyfriend accurately said, they try to cram 100 pounds of [excrement] into a 20 pound bag.In essence: the place is crowded and disorganized. Most Costco parking lots are chock full of mayhem and bumper-carts, but the Waltham Costco's lot is far too small, making it even more chaotic than others.When we walked in the front doors, we looked for a cart just like we do when we go to the Dedham Costco... to discover they were outside in the rain. Very inconvenient, as every Costco I've been a member of (in NY, California, Ohio and now MA) has the carts indoors.Inside, it just feels crowded - moreso than any Costco I've been to. The layout of the store is a little different than others, probably because of the space it's in. We got in and got out as quickly as possible, declaring that from now on we will go back to driving twice as long to get to the Dedham Costco."
Joe P.,"Boston, MA",5,7/4/12,"Love this place.  Saw a TV special saying that they only mark up their merchandise 15% - much less than ever other stores.  Great prices but just as important, they sell high quality products!  I can honestly say I am happy with everything I buy their.  The 50"" TV, gifts for friends and relatives.  Oh yeah, easy to return something.  Items was defective, refund no questions asked.  LOVE THE PLACE!!!To Sarah W. they absolutely DO TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!  To Helene - they would have taken it back.  You believe a repair man?No I don't work at Costco-LOL."
Joe J.,"Winchendon, MA",3,9/17/15,"The prices are very decent and quality is always on par. The somewhat speedy check out lines make this a good location. The place is always packed any time of the day. The only thing negative thing I can say about this place is what the F is with the way people park in the parking lot?! It's amazing how people park on top of each other, crooked and not even in the lines."
Tina P.,"Boston, MA",2,12/3/16,"This Costco sucks. Parking lot is terrible and there is no flow to check out- constantly waiting to get in and out of the store. It seems like things are out of stock a lot. Overall, poorly managed- I would recommend the Dedham location instead."
David M.,"Brookline, MA",5,1/23/12,I travel all over the country and have had consistently great service at Costco's all over.The Staff at this location are my favorites as they go the distance to help!  Always pleasant !!
Don B.,"Newton Lower Falls, MA",1,11/21/15,"I've purchased several sets of tires from the Waltham Costco Tire Center. They have the best prices, reasonable installation fees and very good road hazard warranty. But the wait time is long whether you are dropping off or picking up our car. There is usually just one person working the counter and a few of their employees move slowly. It recently took 15 minutes to get to the counter clerk with just two customers in front of me. The wait for a tire rotation was 2-2.5 hours, and they had just opened. By the way, they will also void your warranty if you don't rotate the tires. I now pay my service station to rotate my tires rather than having it done for free at Costco."
Jeremy K.,"Stoughton, MA",4,11/24/09,"Unlike some CostCos, this one has a liquor section which is definitely a plus if you're trying to throw some parties or want to acquire liquor at a cheaper price. It came handy for me when I had to stock up on champagne for new year's eve. That aside the place is nearly always mobbed and the CostCo in Everett is closer to my house so this one only comes in handy if I'm in the area and/or need alcohol.Just try to avoid going there during peak hours because it's just so damn crowded."
J P.,"Watertown, MA",4,10/7/15,"seems a lot of people here don't know how to shop this Costco - go on an afternoon or weeknight - and never the first weekend after a new coupon book comes out.Good values on bulk items - often have seasonal stuff like gloves in winter, summer stuff, etc.Their liqour store has a good selection and very good prices - close to NH prices.Under-store garage makes for easier parking, in any weather. Often get the impression people don't know about it - they all try to park in the front lot.BJ's (Watertown) has different items, and seems to have more name-brand items. We shop both stores depending on what we are looking for - but that BJ's doen't have a liqour store."
Jorge R.,"Waltham, MA",1,3/8/15,They are into my crap list because of a rude doorman who yelled my wife and made her cry. The manager did nothing about it. I won't go back to buy in that place full of douchebags.
Joanne G.,"Stoneham, MA",3,9/11/12,"They are like BJ's.  Yeah.  Pretty much.Went here with my mom in law (everyone who knows me knows I like hanging out with her).There is a lot to look at and there can be serious deals found.But it can be overwhelming.The bathroom is weirdly situated and not in the best condition but hey, I was only in there for short visit.The people were very friendly and helpful"
Roberto D.,"Arlington, MA",2,1/20/14,"I really like Costco, specially for the quality of its products.But i had a hard time with the young kid working at the Costco Tire Center, i went there for the first time ever to return the used car battery core. The kid was having problem processing a credit card charge, he left everybody there and went to the back to get help. He came back and when he was passing by me, i called him by his name and asked if i was in the right place to drop my used car battery so i could go to my car and get it, instead of answering my polite question, he told me that i had to wait my turn that he was busy taking care of another customer...After finishing with the credit card charge, he called the guy in front of me and for some reason he asked to go outside in the parking lot to understand what the customer wanted, after about 10 minutes he came back and said that he had to punch out, a new guy showed up and and i told him i wanted to return my used battery, he just told me to bring it in and 2 minutes later i was all set..."
madine c.,"Belmont, MA",5,8/30/12,"Such a great deal!  They have a very good selection of frames (good designer brands, too, like Ray-Ban, Calvin Klein, Coach) at really reasonable prices.  I started coming here because the optical shop at my daughter's eye doctor charges so much more for lens and frame packages (essentially twice as much, if not more!).    The guys who work there are really helpful and friendly, too.Highly recommend it!  Even if you don't plan on buying 36-packs of paper towels, the annual Costco membership price + the price of lenses and frames is still less than what you'll spend at a boutique optical shop.  I'm not a contact lens wearer, but I hear their prices are very competitive as well."
Sara M.,"New York, NY",4,8/13/11,"I love Costco.It's just the other people who go to Costco that I don't love.  We have seen many strange things happening here, including one woman who was literally yelling at her husband at the top of her lungs and then started scream crying while they were checking out.Other than that, free samples of food, great deals on bulk items, quality merchandise - it makes up for the craziness."
Michael K.,"Dracut, MA",5,11/15/15,Costco has amazingly low prices on a wide variety of stuff... it is more of a higher end store in terms of selection but there's deals like $6.99/lb when you buy 2 lbs of organic coffee at a time or $6.99 for 1 lb of all natural deli ham with no antibiotics which is easily at least regularly $2/lb more at other stores. Service is acceptable and don't forget they really pay their people more.
H T.,"Silicon Valley, CA",5,11/9/13,"Stopped in here on a weekend to get a few quick things - I was surprised at the types of products they carried here (better than our California costco stores!). I tried not to get distracted since I was in a hurry but I could definitely see how people could spend lots of time at this costco location! They had a nice assortment of fresh flower bouquets and fresh fruit. Since parking was a mess I braced myself for the checkout line but to my surprise,I wasn't met with my typical costco line experience of 15+ minutes. I got in line and made it out the store in less than 5 minutes! This is a great costco location, definitely recommend!"
Anne B.,"Chelmsford, MA",4,1/14/12,"Bought a Vizio 46"" HDTV for the best price around on my first visit.Browsed around trying the finger food samples and found a fewother really good deals on items that I use a lot of. Lines went fastand the self-serve checkout is also cool as is the liquor store priceson wines!"
Steven J.,"Acton, MA",5,7/19/13,"This is one of the best unadvertised benefits of Costco in Waltham.  Larry is a great Dr. and as other posts confirm they provide great service. Over the years, I have had a coating come off, no questions they replaced it.    I will be seeing larry soon, no other option even comes close."
Paige C.,"Tampa, FL",4,7/1/13,"costco super coolbuy berries and meat for famsnack attack and shop!How does one begin a review of Costco?  It's like the American Dream.  Giant bulk cheap everything.  It's a bomb shelter builders paradise, as well as the aspiring restaurant owner.  This particular Costco can get pretty packed on the weekends.  Especially at high sample periods (Saturday and Sunday lunch).  The people are RAVENOUS!  I have three complaints for this Costco.  1. (Probably my fault) Was shopping with my mom's Costco card, and totally got scolded for.  I don't get that. 2. In the liquor store, my friend and his FAMILY (he was with his mom!) couldn't buy because they has out of state licenses.  3. TINY TINY TINY hotdog eating area.  This is not the usual lounge around and eat more food after shopping for more food.  There's space for maybe 15-20 people to sit.  We need more space for hotdog eating!!!!!!!  REMEMBER: The name on you're costco card and credit card have to match."
Kelly S.,"Belmont, MA",1,2/7/16,Just returned from our first ever trip to the Waltham Costco and the frozen ravioli we bought has mold on it-two big hairy spots of mold. It's disgusting. Not happy about this at all.
Andrea M.,"Medford, MA",3,5/31/16,"This review pertains to the Costco tire center in Waltham - I spoke to a gentleman on the phone regarding a potential purchase of 4 brand new tires for my Passat and while the man on the phone was somewhat thorough, I felt extremely rushed by his one or two worded answers.  Additionally, I could barely hear myself speak into the phone as the loud ringer of another phone line on his end continued to ring and ring and ring, which was pretty disturbing. As I understand I am not the only customer to call in inquiry of tire sales, I would have rather him put me on hold to answer the non-stop ringing and get back to me so I could talk to him in peace.  Irregardless of this first impression, the shop was extremely busy, and quoted me ~3 hours to install 4 new tires. I know this isn't always a 1 hour job and with people ahead of me, I understand fully there would be a wait, but what does one do for that long?  There is no way to make an appointment so you can come in and out in a timely manner - if I could make a general suggestion to the tire dept at this location and any other applicable Costco tire center, it would be to allow customers to schedule appointments so you can factor in how long the service might be...that way, you have customers that are aware of how long they will need to be on site for and aren't just loosely walking around the highway sidewalk for 3+ hours. Additionally, not every customer who comes to have their tires swapped out wants to shop in Costco for hours on end.  Just a thought...otherwise, Costco has pretty competitive pricing, especially with online sales/coupons that many probably are unaware of.  Would recommend purchasing tires from Costco to anyone who plans a long shopping trip or lives close by and can go home for a few hours."
Lauran H.,"Newton, MA",4,5/4/14,"This is a great Costco in general, and if you need a cel phone, go to their Costco wireless kiosk and find Gabriela - she's awesome! Great service - she dealt with all the headaches from Verizon's customer service."
J H.,"Somerville, MA",5,10/10/13,"This review is for the Costco pharmacy (which I think you can use without being a member). Our dog is on a mainentance med. It costs $20 for 2 months at Costco. I recently checked at the local chain pharmacy and it would be $50 PER MONTH there. The place generally stresses me out because it is so big and crowded but going there once every 2 months to save $480/ year? Yep. Razors are also insanely cheap. I/m sure other stuff is good too but, again, the place stresses me out."
Sasha R.,"Dartmouth, MA",5,12/21/06,"We're wily and cheap, which is the reason we go to Costco to begin with, so we split a membership with my parents.  We go to Costco once a month to stock up on necessities like shower gel, tampons, toilet paper, advil, frozen chicken breasts, and those little wipey things I use to clean the kitchen counters. There are only two of us, so we try not to buy large amounts of fresh food (it'll go bad), but we do sometimes, and split it with  my parents - and it's always good stuff.  This summer, we bought wholesale amounts of beef for barbecuing when we went down the Cape, and it was a huge success.  Other food has been good too, including tomatoes, hummus, family packs of lean cuisine, and even giant bowls of fruit salad.I am always tempted to sift through the bins of discount clothing, I'm sure there are deals to be had there, but I usually encounter an impatiently tapping foot from my companions so I can't fully indulge.Bottom line, I'm satisfied - for things you're going to use anyway, why not buy ridiculous amounts cheaper?  And while you're there, pick up some food."
Tone A.,"Boston, MA",1,6/23/15,"This place has terrible service. The optometrist is consistently rude on the phone with no sense of customer service. He always seems annoyed at having to answer your questions. I received a call today saying the glasses are ready and to pick them up. When I got there, he said the glasses couldn't possibly ready in a tone suggesting that I was an idiot for assuming otherwise. Prices are good, but is it worth the hassle? You be the judge."
Roni E.,"Waltham, MA",4,9/18/08,"Okay.... so they don't have EVERYTHING. It's definitely not a full liquor store, but they do have a lot of the popular stuff. And while I don't drink the popular stuff (i.e. beer), I do drink wine and hard liquor. But they don't have SoCo!!! But again they do have some wines and on the cheap. I walked out last week with 2 bottles of wine for $16. And if you're ever planning a party, this is definitely the place to go to stock up."
Kay M.,"Beech Mountain, NC",1,10/13/15,"The doctor should not be allowed to answer the phone, or probably see patients for that matter. He was so rude I'm grateful I couldn't get an appointment. Bullet dodged!"
Joseph C.,"Watertown, MA",5,6/13/15,"Costco Tire Center is the best around the greater Boston area. Had two flat tires due to nails and screws and two tires with uneven tred wear...because I failed to rotate tires at 7500 miles. Regardless, after a couple of trips to the center and help from the GM Greg and Joe, they replaced all four tires for a small price and I'm another satisfied Costco customer. Thanks for doing the right thing!"
Brandon W.,"Lexington, MA",5,1/24/10,"Last December, at a Christmas party, I was talking to a guy who turned out to be a wine dealer from Connecticut. When I asked him where were good places to buy wine around Lexington, he leaned over and conspiratorially whispered Costco in Waltham. Turns out he was right. If you are not looking for a large variety, Costco carries some very good wine (many with a Wine Spectator rating of 80 or above - some in the 95+) at a slightly discounted price.  The best thing is you don't need a membership to buy wine or spirits. All you have to do is go through the left door (the exit). Just tell the employee at the door you are going to the wine store. I think I am going to spend a little more time at Costco next weekend. :)"
pete k.,"Acton, MA",5,4/22/08,"Simply put.. Costco is a way of life. It might not make sense to ""outsiders"".. but once you are ""in the know"".. its a special place. Not everything here is ""bulk"" stuff - the secret to enjoying Costco is relishing in their fine (really) selection of consumer goods, from electronics to furnishings to clothing, and even books. Its a veritable buffet of things you probably don't need, but the prices are so damn good that its hard to not buy them. For instance. I need an extension cord. Costco does not have a simple extension cord.. but, they have a kick ass power strip with a heavy duty extension cord in the package. 2 for 1 right! Yup. Except its total overkill.. which is fine with me. I think that's a common occurence  - overkill - which really means, long term effectiveness. If you buy things right the first time, they will last you a long time. Costco simply ensures that. You can't go in there to buy a POS cordless phone or DVD player. But, they have really good cordless phones and DVD players at great prices - and not much more than the POS that you'd buy at Target. Your Costco purchase will last you much, much longer. The truth is, the company actually hand-selects what goes into the warehouse - nothing IN Costco is really ""crap"". They provide quality items, so they keep their customer base. Its genius, really, and you'll see that Costco is generally ""recession"" proof. People won't stop going there. This Costco in particular - don't ever park in the outdoor lot. Its MAYHEM. Go right for the garage. Go after work during the week. DO NOT go on the weekends unless you are ready to put up with crowds of clueless shoppers and screaming babies and getting elbowed out of the way for a free sample of a chicken nugget. Like someone else mentioned - I too wish they had an ""express"" line. That would be the ultimate. And, the snack bar - where else can you eat that cheap? Mmmm. And its all food you can buy in the freezer section. Oh, and on that note, do not look at the nutrition info on those Chicken Bakes. Ever."
Ling W.,"Lexington, MA",1,2/15/16,"It used to be ok, But this year, Waltham Costco has become the most terrible place I have ever shopped. Most employees there are cold and rude including managers. The quality of the products are also getting worse. You can even smell the rotten fruits when you approach that section. You can get easily better service and price some where else, such as BJ's, Market Basket, Sam's..."
Kya F.,"Newton, MA",5,9/22/06,"Costco rocks my world.  I am such a Costco addict.For those of you who don't know, Costco is a membership warehouse chain.  Meaning you have to pay to be a member to shop there, but then you get to buy stuff at close to wholesale price.Costco has pretty much everything you could ever want.  Plasma TVs, iPods, clothes, toys, food, toiletries, diapers, towels, tires, mattresses, the list goes on and on.  The food and a few other items you need to buy in bulk (like 48 rolls of toilet paper, or 24 cups of yogurt).  The rest of it you can by individually.  A lot of the cheapest stuff is their house brand - Kirklands.  But they sell a lot of name brands and higher end products also.  Calvin Klein jeans, Annie's Shells and Cheese, Newman's Own pasta sauce.I go specifically for video games, DVDs and books, which are usually a few dollars cheaper than you can get them at other stores in the area (but not as cheap as you can get them online).A nice thing about Costco is that they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  So you can return anything anytime (except maybe computers?) as long as you have your receipt.  Also, they always have little sample carts set up in the food area, so if you're hungry there's plenty to munch on.A drawback is the membership fee, obviously, but I find it well worth it.  Plus, they only take cash, checks or American Express.  No Visa or Mastercard.  Your membership card is not transferable, so you can't lend it to a friend, though your friend is welcome to come with you."
Becka D.,"Southborough, MA",4,2/23/09,"Sure...not a full liquor store, so the selection is limited. But on the plus side, they try to stay seasonal with what they have (champagne around New Years, Guinness around St. Patty's). Also on the plus side (for non-Costco members at least), no need for the membership to shop this part of the store. Yay!Great place to load up on wine, or for stocking for a party."
Loan L.,"Highland Park, IL",3,7/28/08,"Unfortunately, the only time we go here is on the weekends, which is the worst. Seriously, do people like not eat before they come here so that they can shovel down every free sample of Nabisco crackers they can? Do they have any friggen idea as to how annoying it is to try to maneuver one's self around the hoards of lemmings in line to shovel more free food down? Some people like myself actually go to Costco to buy stuff and it's kind of hard when people are blocking the aisle for the 2nd or 3rd helping of sausage on a wafer.Another reason why I am starting to despise Costco is that there are no signs to indicate what in God's green earth are in the aisles. This place is like the size of 2 football fields, and unless you have a blueprint of the area, you have to walk into every damn aisle to find what you're looking for.Last, why is there some person in the entrance checking to see if you have a Costco card? I mean, it's not like we can buy the items at the checkout register without the card...so why be there? Every time we enter, i have to hold the shopping cart in one hand, while digging into my purse to find the card with the other hand. Very annoying."
Meg W.,"CA, CA",3,10/30/06,"Buying a card is what had stopped me in the past from going to Costco.  But, last weekend a friends mom hooked us up.  I said I was my friends 'roomate', although the addresses on our licenses are different. With a $10 gift card I was given @ the time I signed up was the total membership fee was $15 for one year.  Even if you live alone or with one person Costco is a good place to shop.  Although it's best for businesses, families, or people who have a few roommates.  I will be buying all my paper goods here, i.e. TP, paper towels, and printing paper.  I also plan to buy the big pack of Annie's Mac and Cheese which I cannot live without.  They have other veggie stuff like veggie burgers, and some natural foods.  The meat selection is also great, big roasts, 2 in a pack for around $14.  They even have roasted duck, how classy!  The wine selection is better than what I can find in my hood too.  I will say this place is overwhelming for a few reasons:1) It's freaking LARGE2) The same people who can't drive their cars, can't push these over-sized carts either.  Can you say shopping cart traffic jams?3) Getting here is a little confusing, it's one turn after another.So three stars for not having a good selection of actual vegetables, and real fruit.  But worth it if you know that what you spend on the membership saves you money in the long run."
Jimmie L.,"Waltham, MA",5,9/26/06,"The Costco Liquor department may not have EVERYTHING you are looking for, but you will find something you like.We routinely find bottles of wine well below what we can buy it for at Marty's or Martignetti's.  If it is $15 at a normal liquor store, you are looking at between $9 - $11 at Costco.  It is far easier to rationalize a case of wine at Costco than anywhere else.And the beer and liquor as well.  An 8-pack of Guinness cans at a liquor store costs slightly less than a 16 pack at Costco.  Champagne is also at the discount.Well worth the trip out to Waltham."
Helene O.,"Cambridge, MA",1,6/2/12,"Beware of making major electronics purchases from Costco. Standard manufacturer warranties may not apply because the item was the ""made for Costco"" model.I bought a Panasonic HD plasma TV there. When it broke (dead), I hired a Panasonic repair person to come to fix it. He came with the part needed and told me that since it was a known flaw, Panasonic covers the cost of the repair. However, WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE TV WAS PURCHASED AT COSTCO, THE WARRANTY NO LONGER APPLIED. Long story short:  If I had bought the same TV at Best Buy (the ""Z"" model instead of the ""C"" as in Costco model), the TV would have been repaired free of charge and I would be watching TV now. Instead, after a month and 22 phone calls with Costco concierge service (they keep telling me to wait another week while they discuss the issue with Panasonic), I am without a TV and now looking to purchase something else - anywhere but Costco."
Honest A.,"Boston, MA",1,11/1/15,The worst. Endless lines and they don't care how much they inconvenience their customers. Prices are much better at Market Basket or almost anywhere. I rejoined to save on tires. Now I remember why I had quit. Wish there were a zero star option.
Jeremy K.,"Glastonbury, CT",3,1/25/09,"3.5, or 3 at wholesale prices what can you really say, if you know what to expect, this could be a real good place to shop. so what should you expect? weeelll.. crazy mobs of crazy people vying for free samples of stuff not that all exciting...but free, and thats not bad. my highlighted sample was a part of a bakery fresh (or few hoursold) danish. we sat like the rest of the vultures waiting for our chance and swoop in on the new tray. it was MTA day or something. which reminds me: 95% of the employees are zombies, repetitive zombies repetitive zombies there were a couple of helpful people there, we only discovered them after waiting in a messy line for 20 minutes after we were told by a said zombie to 'grunt'. hey, we thought we could land our hdtv there, and the daypass was already sponsored so maybe we could iffff... as i was saying, if you have no limit to storage and/or square footage, places like this are gold jerry, gold! for us though? the membership doesnt outweigh the amount of times we could stock up for a marginal savings on one 30 pack of TP or 2 cases of soda, you know what im cooking here? its like the tvs i was referring to before, i see a savings on a 50+ incher, but nothing worthy of my humble educator dwellings. the membership is 50 beans and they claim you can refund it on the 364th day or some jazz like that, but i wouldnt even try to pull that dandy off. they also only take Amex or cash, thats it. one last thing, if you do fit the demo, spring for the exec membership for a hundi, you get back 2% and coupons and crap if you are spending 2500 bux or something, (real specif gerko!@) yea yea"
Andrew B.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,9/6/12,"Good products, fair selection, mostly great prices, sub-par customer service. I've been a customer at this location for about 10 years.Good products/fair selection - you can often find good/interesting wines here, but the overall selection is very limited. Occasionally you'll find amazing wines in their value-priced range, but other times you'll just get the huge names you'll find in any wine store (who wants that much Yellow Tail?) at a slight discount. I do wish they had more selection in the sub-$10 range (especially since I've never seen a sub $6 wine at Costco, but have had some good ones from Trader Joe's).The prices are always at least good, but sometimes you find amazing prices - especially if you're willing to go for the Kirkland Signature brand. I think the best deals are in premium spirits, but the wine is pretty good too. Their KS mixed beer pack is OK, but doesn't go over as well at parties.I think I have been carded 5% of the time I've gone there. I look (and am) well over 21, but an employee once told me that it's also because I've been an executive member for so long, and you have to be 18 to join (I was over 21 when I joined, but it's still been a long time), so I was clearly well over 21. I recently moved out of state, and updated my license accordingly, and that was enough for me to be treated like a criminal at this location. As others have noted, their policy (not their sign) states that every member of the party has to have a passport or MA drivers license on them (silly me for not realizing I needed my passport to visit friends and family in MA). It was extra annoying because my wife still has a MA license, so if I had known about the ""every member"" policy I could have just let her shop on her own. The worst thing was that the clerk held onto my license, and I had to wait about 10 minutes for a manager to show up and also treat me like a criminal, instead of just handing it back and explaining the policy to me. They're welcome to have whatever policy they want, but you don't need to detain me, waste my time, or be grumpy about it (I thought Costco was supposed to be an awesome place to work).Note: they claim it's the law in Waltham, but the law only states what is allowed to be used as ID to prove the BUYER is over 21, but doesn't require that every person in a party be 21 (or have ID). This makes sense, because any other way would prohibit parents from ever buying alcohol unless they left their kids at home. The sign matches Waltham law, but their policy is more strict (even though they pretend they're just following the law). The laws can be viewed here: city.waltham.ma.us/sites… (section III.3)"
Iska B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,11/10/06,"I don't have a card, so I tag along with my roommate who does. This place is where you come to get your bulk items, not to go grocery shopping unless you have a huge family. We save a lot of money by buying our toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags, and dishwasher liquid here. The food comes in enormous quantities so it's not really the place to go to buy food for yourself, unless it's frozen. Frozen is great because it last a while and you can work your way through 5 pounds of strawberries at your own pace. Though it would probably help to have one of those big freezers since the one on top of the fridge is usually pretty small.You will save money here on most items that you go through fast as well, such as contact lens solution, feminine hygiene products and toothbrushes. It's also nice to always have stuff like that in stock at home so you don't have an ""oh crap I'm out of this and need to rush over to CVS"" moment. And yes the books are also discounted and they usually have a decent selection of NY Times bestsellers in both hardcover and paperback but it's hit or miss, it's not a real bookstore so they don't have a huge collection. Yeah the membership is kind  of annoying to pay for, but if you're like me, you can come along with a friend who may have one, but you always have to come with them they cannot just lend it to you. Also I've heard that school teachers get a discount on membership (maybe other people do to?)"
Ella B.,"Arlington, MA",5,11/27/11,"I am a Costco devotee.Now, I have not had consistently great experiences in the store, but that's due to other customers.  To those of you out there:  please don't block the aisles!  Carts can be moved to the side!I purchased an HP printer from Costco.  It died 7 days out of warranty and HP wouldn't speak to me without charging me $$$.  I called Costco to confirm the purchase date and they told me to bring it back for a full refund!  WHA--????  And the beautiful part:  they took it back!  And they were pleasant!  I had no box, no receipt, and they dutifully and patiently took care of it.  As a small business owner, I was not happy to think I'd have to replace such a new printer.  And thanks to Costco, I didn't have to!  (Odd that Costco would stand by a product that HP wouldn't, but that's another review....)So, I purchased a better Brother printer from Costco.  It arrived within a few days, no shipping costs, no business interruption.For that and so many other reasons, they have my business without question.  Thank you!"
Brian W.,"Andover, MA",4,8/1/09,"How can you go wrong with Costco? It's great for regular purchases like frozen chicken (portioned out nicely into 6 individual perforated pouches), contact solution, honey wheat pretzels, drinks, and even beer. The real joy of shopping at Costco is going down each aisle to see if any new treasures have been added in between the electric toothbrush and that 16 gallon drum of mayo. Sometimes Costco surprises you with great deals on Tumi luggage and you can always find the newest books at 50% off the list price. This place is great if you have the room to store the bulk goodies. I would also caution against visiting on a weekend - these other reviews aren't lying about the clueless drones fighting with themselves over a tablespoon of chicken salad on a cracker."
Sarah A.,"Pawtucket, RI",4,10/21/08,"Ah, how I love COSTCO. Kiss, kiss, sweet COSTCO, mmm. I am so psyched about the seven beautiful pieces of clothing I bought here for less than $100 in total. Extremely functional sweaters for work ($16.99), excellent little fleeces for the cold weather ahead ($12.99- $16.99), and some lovely fleece pants ($16.99) for lounging around. My other happy purchases included a gigantic ball of Laughing Cow cheeses, a huge ass chunck of chevre for a mere $4.39 (same price but 2.5 times the size of the ones at Trader Joe's) jugs of cranberry juice and a gallon of milk for under $3. Bliss! My only complaint is that they are not open later. This store and most other COSTCOs I have am acquainted with close on 6 on Sundays. We made it in time to grab those beautiful clothes, but I was being chased out of the back of the store as I was attempting to grab the milk and cheese. That said, by the time we actually checked out and got in the car it was 6:20, so they do give you a little time after the official close to check out. As others have noted, for trips to COSTCO you really cannot leave home without your AMEX."
Freelunch L.,"Hudson, MA",3,8/15/07,"Lines are long during weekend.  Why couldn't they make 10 items or less lines?Great frozen section - plenty of chicken, breaded chicken, pizza, ... for those teenagers.Great deals:Good AA battery deal (40 for ~$10).Best packaging for chicken.  Six individually vacuumed packed chicken (thigh, breast, ...etc). You can store much longer than the regular BIG pack from a supermarket.How can you beat the rotisserie chicken for $4.99?  It is much bigger than the ones from supermarket.Eyeglasses.  If you can find the right frame(limited selection), it is a great deal.  Single vision $50 for lens + frame ($40-$120).Contacts:  J+J everyday are $16/box vs walmart $21/box. 1 year saving $120 vs membership of $50.Tires... how can you beat them? $10/tire mounting and life time rotation+balance.Electronics - used to have the best return policy until some abuse it.  People used to buy a computer and return it for a full refund after 2 years.  No question asked... However, it still have a great policy. (90 days return and 2 year extended warranty)"
Betty M.,"East Arlington, MA",5,8/31/10,"We LOVE Costco!!  Besides getting food, paper towels, cleaning supplies, etc. we've come home with a flat screen TV, luggage, fluffy bath towels, down comforters, space heaters, air conditioners and even a car (sort of).  Most people don't know that they have an auto program that provides rock bottom prices for Costco members through certain authorized dealerships.  There is no haggling.  I saved a lot of money - and a lot of hassle!  Costco also is my ""go to"" place for photo development.  You can't beat professional quality for ridiculously low prices ($0.13/4x6; $0.39/5x7; & $1.49/8x10).  Jackie is very knowledgeable and helpful.  The Waltham store also sells liquor.  Again, at great savings (e.g., case of Blue Moon is $24 vs. $32 at most liquor stores).  They also have their own brand of tequila, which, according to my husband, is nice and smooth.Returns are hassle free as well.  It's well worth the membership price!"
Susan D.,"Pasadena, CA",3,7/27/10,"The variety is pretty decent. Lots of brand names in huge containers. If you're looking for a lifetime supply of Hellman's, this is where you will get it. However, I don't think that the actual prices are a bargain. For most of the items, you're better off waiting for sales at your local stores and using coupons. This is true for things like toilet paper, breads, etc. The meats and fruits were similarly priced to what you might find at Shaw's for regular price.If you have a big family and need lots of food in one place, stopping here would be worth it."
Yvette L.,"Waltham, MA",5,2/26/12,"Where else can you get a hot dog with endless drink refills for $1.50, and their rotisseri chicken is the best.  I'm there at least once a week."
Amanda M.,"Newton, MA",4,11/10/08,"This Costco location is the closest one to my house and there are a few items that I just can't resist: Fresh Rotisserie Chicken (I have heard the cooked ribs are good too!) Huge box of organic spring mix salad greens Bulk bag of Ocean Spray CRAISINS! *** Hmm this list sounds like a good dinner - Cranberry salad with roasted chicken?!? They also have great prices on cheese, even some varieties of Cabot that you may not find in the regular grocery store. Big squares of feta for making spinach pie, quiche, greek salad - give me feta and I'll find a million ways to use it ...yummm! I'm not really big on the samples. Last time I was there they were giving out Stride gum, kind of weird. I always feel bad taking a sample when I know I have no intention of buying a 50 pack of yogurt smoothies or something like that. Plus people get so worked up trying to get samples, it's just not worth it. They have a nice selection of books, games, toys and general gift items so you can actually knock out some holiday shopping. Ohhh and the snack bar has some decent selections, I like the chicken bakes which remind me of hot pockets, but I try to just get the hot dog combo or soft serve.This location also has a vision center and a photo lab.  There is a fine jewelry case, but I'm not sure how I would feel if my engagement ring came from Costco.AMEX, Debit, Cash or Check."
Amy L.,"Green Lake, Seattle, WA",4,8/15/07,"Sometimes I feel bad about buying strawberries in the middle of winter imported from Chili, but I figure buying in bulk might make it up a little.I love buying things in bulk, and the frozen chicken breasts are fantastic. It's the cheapest place to buy a gallon of milk in the area, and the produce really isn't too bad. We always buy the ground turkey while we're there and when they had them, the frozen strawberries which are fantastic.Plus, who doesn't love samples? They do only take American Express, debit cards, checks and cash which can be a pain if you don't remember."
David R.,"Ardmore, PA",2,5/12/11,"Costco liquors has a small but decent selection of higher end liquor at great prices.  The scotch in particular is a great buy here.One warning though (and the reason I am giving 2 stars) is their absurd ID policy.  You must have a passport or mass id for everyone in your party to by here.My fiance and I came here to shop for a party and after buying a ton of food, went to pick up the liquid fun.  I hand the cashier my mass drivers license, costco card, and and credit card (all matching).  He said he needs ID from everyone in the party so my fiance hands over her NJ id.  He was polite but said he has to check with a manager since it is out of state.  The manager comes over, doesn't even look at us or her ID, and immediately screams that we have to show him a passport or leave the store and not come back for at least one business day! He made it seem like this was a reasonable request, and that we would of course be carrying passports.I understand their need to protect themselves, but we are in our mid 20s, well over the legal drinking age and both had valid government IDs proving our age.   My fiance with the out of state ID wasn't even purchasing the alcohol! He could have used discretion, or at the very least not been so rude."
Ellen C.,"New York, NY",3,12/8/08,"I love Costco. There are, however, a few things I would choose to improve.  Most notably: difficulty sharing a house membership. We're college students. We live together. However, these are not our permanent addresses, and we aren't related.  It'd still be nice to be able to have some different people shop every week rather than me always going.Additionally, not taking credit cards other than AmEx is very sad.The parking lot is always awful. And I always manage to get inside before remember I have to grab a cart BEFORE going in.Of course, you can't argue with: samples, $1.50 hot dog and drink, and some of the great things they have there. I hear other Costco's have Dunkaroos, which makes me a bit sad at mine, but I still haven't had a bad shopping experience there."
B K.,"Ashland, MA",4,5/9/10,"My fiancee and I joined Costco shortly after moving to Watertown two years ago.  It's become our replacement outlet for 90% of the things we used to buy at Shaw's or Stop & Shop.Prices on bulk items are generally good (especially lunch staples like granola bars), milk is literally half the price it is at the grocery store (2.29 vs. 4.59 as of this writing) and I love the hotdog and soda combo for 1.50 - mmm, nitrates!Do NOT go at peak hours.  First thing on a weekend is usually fine as long as you don't spend too much time browsing.  Forget showing up at noon on a Sunday unless you have a standing-in-line fetish or like discovering half the things you planned on buying sold out and haven't been restocked yet.We also use the Costco-branded American Express card, which has pretty decent rewards."
Kelly M.,"Waltham, MA",2,5/16/11,"Parking sucks. if you plan on going here on any weekend afternoon, prepared for major stress inside the store and out. Overcrowded, crazy check out lanes. If you do not have a massachusetts driver's license, you better not think about stepping into the booze section without a PASSPORT. They will not accept any out-of-state driver's license without a passport. Also, you have to pay either with debit, cash, or American express. They will not accept any other credit card. Also, if your boyfriend, mother, sister, or whoever is buying the groceries but the membership is under your name, be prepared to get a hard time for it. One check out lady (a russian one who seems to be the only one who has an issue with this) said my sister couldn't pay with her Amex because the membership was under my name. Seriously?! What kind of business doesn't accept money?"
Sharon B.,"Cambridge, MA",1,12/20/10,"Most ridiculous nonsense. Went in to pick up a gift membership for Christmas, was told you cant buy a gift membership without a membership. I looked at the woman thinking she had to be joking. Let me get this, I'm trying to buy a membership that increases your sales but you won't take this sale because I'm not a member. Are you serious? This goes down in the books as the most idiotic policy ever.  I hope this company goes bankrupt as I'll be giving my sales to BJs or another wholesaler."
Joseph G.,"Brookline, MA",5,5/18/06,"A let you all in a little known secret.  You do not need to be a member of Costco to buy at their liquor department.  They carry all named brands at discounts from 25-40% over most others.  Check it out, then invite me for Margaritas.  I'll bring the nachos."
M. D.,"Woodland, CA",1,1/10/08,"The sales lady treated me and my wife like criminals. I had my I.D. (drivers license) but my wife did not because she is newly from another country. We both look way old enough, and the lady swiped the bottles away like a bully taking toys from a child and told us that she couldnt help us out and looked at us hatefully. This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had. We complained to the manager on the phone who did his best to explain about the alcohol sales policies at Costco. Luckily he was kind and did his best to try to explain why their staff might have acted this way.  I know that there are stiff fines for selling to underaged people, and liquor stores have their policies, but there was no reason to treat loyal paying members of Costco in this hateful, loathesome manner. It doesnt pay to save a few dollars when treated this way. I love Costco and still shop at Waltham, but after the incident with this witch I buy my wine and spirits elsewhere, like Cambridge Wine at Fresh Pond where they have wine samplings and helpful, knowledgable and friendly staff."
Cate K.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9/28/08,"Yes, we live in an apartment - and yes, we can still shop at costco and have room to move around!  Couple tips:--if you're going as a guest with a member, they only take CASH or AMEX (i wish they would change this, but hey, it's not that bad once you're used to it)--they have an EXCELLENT Return Policy - you don't need a receipt at all, since they have your membership number. You can always return anything for any reason.  Shop without fear!  This especially useful for electronics.--if you're an impulse-buyer like me, go in with a LIST. --go nuts on nuts and other non-perishables (paper products, cosmetics, etc.) but be wary of perishables: it's easy to get crazy and forget your freezer/fridge size--They have a liquor section in the back, behind the registers! But only like 3 types of beer, one of which is corona -- boo!--always check the expiration date - not because things are old, but because you need to ask yourself, ""can I use/eat all this before the date?""  That will have an effect on your price-performance."
Melissa M.,"Waltham, MA",2,1/7/11,Not a big fan. Bad location in a Waltham labrinth. Horrible parking lot that is way too small. Confusing floor plan designed to make customers wander aimlessly. Overcrowded. Insanely obnoxious check-out. Products are decent. But too many cons & not worth the aggravation. The newer BJs offers an overall more enjoyable shopping experience!
Lauren W.,"Boston, MA",5,1/9/07,"We made the trip from Boston to this Costco location Saturday night just to buy wine. Thanks to all the yelp reviews we knew where to go for a Costco Liquor. We bought our standard items at this Costco, chicken, pork chops, cleaning products, etc. But we also got to buy a case of wine. My husband and I love wine so this trip saved us a good deal of money. The case of wine cost us $150. We figured out that we saved at least $2 on every bottle. Our wine fridge and wallets are now more full then they were before!"
Nathan T.,"Waterville, ME",4,8/24/11,"As always you can't beat the prices but the customer service at the service desk was SUPER slow. If you need to hit the service desk, give yourself extra time. If you park in the parking garage below the store be warned - there is no elevator but you will avoid some of the craziness of the upstairs parking lot. Try the frozen MorningStar Chipolte Black Bean Burgers, they are incredible."
Luke R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5,7/9/08,"I am fully convinced that Costco is a cult. How many people get excited to go to Shaw's or Stop N' Shop? I've never talked to anyone who wasn't excited to go to Costco. The Waltham Costco is pretty standard. Has a liquor store with some good deals (as good of a deal as you can get in our controlled state). Whenever I head back to Michigan to visit family I am amazed by how many more samples the Costco back home has. My only other complaint is that the eating section is always dirty, sticky, and gross. It almost makes me think twice about the $1.50 hotdog/drink..."
Girldrinkdrunk S.,"Auburn, MA",2,5/12/11,"The prices are fine, but they don't carry any of their own Kirkland line, which is why we went in the first place.  LAME."
Joyce K.,"Waltham, MA",5,7/21/06,Great deals of booooooze!!!!  We got bombay sapphire here for 17ish dollars!  Stoli Elit for $50!!  Johnny Walk Blue Label for um...don't remember but not more than $200!  Raspberry Stoli was less than $20....we got alotta booze for really cheap!  You need a MA id or passport to buy which sucks but the deals are awesome!
Abby R.,"Toronto, Canada",5,7/23/07,"I friggin' love Costco, and quite frankly, who doesn't?  Who doesn't need a gallon or margarine?  One thing I love is watching what copious amounts of food others buy.  A few favorites: expensive beauty products can frequently be found at a fraction of the price at sephora; fruit and veggies are normally cheaper; bottled water; appliances and housewares; great place for dog/cat supplies; office supplies; stuff for cleaning & booze too! (they don't sell booze at Costco in Canada).  They also have pretty yummy food, albeit somewhat heavy, but hey - it's Costco and it's cheap.  You gotta pay cash, amex or debit, so budget accordingly.  Quite frankly, what can't you get at Costco?  Great deals - totally love it - I can get everything I need!"
KittyCat G.,"Middlesex, MA",5,7/23/10,"We started with a membership for diapers and wipes, but Costco provides so much more.  After stocking up on paper goods, batteries, light bulbs, detergents (and they are stocking more environmentally friendly stuff, albeit mounds and mounds of stuff evoking scary flashbacks to Wall-E), our small family still buys groceries at Costco.  Our son refuses all cocktail shrimp that is not from Costco, and truth be told, it's damn good stuff - better than Whole Foods and Legal's shrimp!  Julia Child apparently said she'd prefer beef from Savenor's, then Costco.  Great steaks (freeze half for later), veal scallopini, buffalo mozzarella, Starbucks coffee, and organic chicken are all things that we might not buy elsewhere due to the price.  And you find random amazing things like the most delish salt/pepper pistachios under their Kirkland brand.  And how did I ever host a party before Costco???  I'm not planning on returning for diapers, but I'll be a Costco member forever."
Shari J.,"Canton, MA",4,8/19/08,"I''m only partially obsessed with Costco.  When I go inside, I tend to flit around like a crazy caged bird, cuz there is just so much to see and samples to be had!  At the end of the day, I usually only come out of the store having purchased like two things (totally defeats the purpose!), but some of the stuff they sell in there is just so random and amusing.  And the sample people...well, you don't mess with them, or you're getting NOTHING!  I love their muffins, mmmm.  And the ""food court"" is wicked cheap!  Hot dog and soda (with free refills) for $1.50 and a huge fro-yo for a buck and change...yessir!  I'd definitely come here just for lunch before.  The seating area is a little crowded and sticky/gross, so I tend to just grab and go.  Oh yea, and you definitely need to master the ""Costco walk"" to make your way around here, these people are crazy!  Anyway, I loves it and somehow I always find a magically parking space in the first row before the garage, sweeeet!"
Erik C.,"Waltham, MA",1,2/26/09,"Usually, when I have been to a Costco store, I have not had a membership. They cost too much for the frequency that I would go there. When I had a trial membership (I forget where now) I learned that it was not required and that they could add a surcharge at some percentage like %10 or something... I bought many things from Costco without the membership. When I moved to Waltham, I talked to a person on the phone because I was looking for a particular item and I wasn't sure if they had it. She told me that I could not buy anything from the store in Waltham without a membership and there there were no free trial memberships whatsoever. That sounds pretty stingy to me."
Anna S.,"Cambridge, MA",5,1/11/07,"Costco is amazing.  Whether you buy in bulk regularly or not, you will save money and have fun.  I enter and it feels like a wonderland.  Huge boxes of cereal. Gigantic cartons of orange juice.  It is so cool.  And really, you save money.  Try it."
Kay B.,"Boston, MA",5,12/11/07,"Costco is great.  This one also has a tire place with GREAT deals on tires.  The best part is, while they change your tires, you can shop!  Everyone who works here is friendly and nice."
Michael c.,"Southborough, MA",5,11/7/08,"Can I just say that I have an incredible shopping experience every time I go here?  Now, I can't say that I enjoy the company of my fellow shoppers who always seem to be in the way with their big carts or hold me up while they load up on free samples, but everyone who works there goes out of their way to be friendly and help you.  They all seem to be members of a winning team, support each other, and provide outstanding customer service.  In addition, I always shop with my two kids in the cart, and every worker gives a smile, talks to them, tells me how cute they are, etc.  I always leave in a good mood.  Keep up the great work!!"
Don M.,"Boston, MA",5,2/3/10,"Excellent. And, the wine shop is simply the best in Boston ... period."
W. B.,"Portsmouth, NH",5,10/4/20,"Another, consistently phenomenal experience as a customer of the Costco Everett Tire Center. Today, balance and rotate tires and wheels. The job was flawlessly done, and our car was returned clean, neat, the way I left it, and with no surprises (e.g. door dings, damage (as I've experienced at other businesses)). The staff were a pleasure to do business with. Due to Covid 19, there is no where to sit/wait, so you are relegated to the warehouse to shop/spend money (realize how much money you save, by shopping at Costco). Leave it to Diane in the Optical Department - - always gracious, helpful, knowledgable, and professional - - to help me find a new pair of eyeglasses."
Elaine C.,"Boston, MA",1,6/11/20,"I enjoy going to Costco. Less people than BJ's and I don't need to be carrying around coupons! If it's on sale, Costco will display it on their sign/prices.Due to COVID lines are a lot longer than usual, but I'm okay with that because I go in and get what I need and leave, NBD.I found everything I needed and was sent to a specific cashier and register.. I helped the cashier (Jennifer G) out by putting everything I can on the belt. I was using a different form of payment for a couple items and I asked for a separate receipt/transaction. Cashiers done it before, here at Costco and at other places, so I didn't think it was a big deal.. but apparently it was. The ""bagger,"" (which I caught her name) said thats fine when I asked her at first. Jennifer scanned the items and then stopped, but then started scanning everything else. I kindly asked if she can take the extra stuff she scanned off and she said, ""I already said you can't do that! It has to go on the same receipt, she already told you that!"" She was very rude and clearly did not care. I told her that's not what the bagger told me. The bagger came over and said it'll be on the same receipt but with a different subtotal. She explained that normally it can be done. I really appreciate the bagger explaining this to me, like I expressed to her. But Jennifer G needs to go stock or something. She is rude and has a nasty attitude for no reason, this is no way acceptable to be in the customer service field. This is the wrong job to you Jennifer G!"
David R.,"Revere, MA",3,5/27/19,Costco is known for selling large quantities of food and supplies etc at discounted prices.  Well everyone writes about that always the same old - bought x-amount of this and saved so much.  So I thought I would take a different approach and tell you all about the concession stand ?? After all we are Yelpers. The food counter at Cosco is also a bargain they serve up hotdogs and sausages like  it's nobody's business.  The dogs are large and juicy and you put on your own condiments.  The sausages are also large served on a sub roll with peppers and onions. They also serve up a few other fast food type items pizza chicken etc.  all priced less than if you bought anywhere else.  So next time you have a craving for a sausage or a dog go to Cisco food counter and spend $3-5 for some greatness in a bun.  Lol.  While your there you may as well get a years supply of something.  Hahaha.  Enjoy!!!

Like most Costcos, it gets insanely busy on the weekends, and the check-out lines seem to wrap around the store.Overall, the stock at this location is great. The food court is also good.

Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",4,11/8/18,"Going to Costco once a week seems like a good habit. The Everett Costco is so close to my home so that I end up going there sometimes more than once. What I like:- Great basic products of high quality. Milk, eggs, frozen edamame are usually in my cart.What I do not like:- Fruits and vegetables are of varying quality. One needs to check every item carefully. Even if Costco takes everything back that is not perfect, who would bother to return a box of oranges for one or two moldy ones?- Do not go on Saturdays, which I call Chinese carnival. When you see the lines of extended families craving free samples, you'd understand. It is great for them (and Costco), but not so great when you want to get in and out fast.

I got a pork loin for ~$3.50 which literally fed my family for almost a whole week. Wat.Of course there's loads of deals on other things too. Very good if you know what you enjoy eating even if you have a lot of it, and if you have ways to store it. Great value, and fantastic quality.

Ziggy T.,"Boston, MA",1,10/16/19,"What a rude encounter I had with the cashier Jen this past weekend. A friend and I stopped in for a few things and decided to share a cart.

We noticed that when she got to the end of my purchase, she quickly removed the separator and continued scanning the items that my friend was purchasing. We politely mentioned that these were separate purchases. She rudely snapped back ""then you should've had your membership card on the belt"". No apology, no remorse, just condescendingly  talking down to us because we didn't do it her way.

Nathan L.,"Allston, MA",2,6/24/18,"I used to be a major Costco fan but I am continuously getting less and less so for the following reasons. -In the Boston area, Market Basket pricing on most items is competitive with Costco without requiring me to store ridiculously large quantities of stuff in my small apartment or buy a paid membership. -The rental car discounts are nice but I can get the same discount through USAA. -This location took over two hours to do the so called ""free"" tire rotation. It is not a ""free"" tire rotation. It is a service that I paid for as part of the original price of the tires I bought from a Costco. I keep my Costco membership only because the person who I has my second executive membership card spends a tremendous amount of money. The 2% rebate I get covers the cost of membership.

I helped the cashier (Jennifer G) out by putting everything I can on the belt. I was using a different form of payment for a couple items and I asked for a separate receipt/transaction. Cashiers done it before, here at Costco and at other places, so I didn't think it was a big deal.. but apparently it was. The ""bagger,"" (which I caught her name) said thats fine when I asked her at first. Jennifer scanned the items and then stopped, but then started scanning everything else. I kindly asked if she can take the extra stuff she scanned off and she said, ""I already said you can't do that! It has to go on the same receipt, she already told you that!"" She was very rude and clearly did not care. I told her that's not what the bagger told me. The bagger came over and said it'll be on the same receipt but with a different subtotal. She explained that normally it can be done. I really appreciate the bagger explaining this to me, like I expressed to her. But Jennifer G needs to go stock or something. She is rude and has a nasty attitude for no reason, this is no way acceptable to be in the customer service field. This is the wrong job to you Jennifer G!"

David R.,"Revere, MA",3,5/27/19,Costco is known for selling large quantities of food and supplies etc at discounted prices.  Well everyone writes about that always the same old - bought x-amount of this and saved so much.  So I thought I would take a different approach and tell you all about the concession stand ?? After all we are Yelpers. The food counter at Cosco is also a bargain they serve up hotdogs and sausages like  it's nobody's business.  The dogs are large and juicy and you put on your own condiments.  The sausages are also large served on a sub roll with peppers and onions. They also serve up a few other fast food type items pizza chicken etc.  all priced less than if you bought anywhere else.  So next time you have a craving for a sausage or a dog go to Cisco food counter and spend $3-5 for some greatness in a bun.  Lol.  While your there you may as well get a years supply of something.  Hahaha.  Enjoy!!!
Megan H.,"Boston, MA",3,2/19/19,"I'm a big Costco fan, and I often visit this particular location. Like most Costcos, it gets insanely busy on the weekends, and the check-out lines seem to wrap around the store.Overall, the stock at this location is great. The food court is also good. The real trouble with this particular Costco is its location. It's situated in a busy strip mall, which seems to get busier each year. Even if you can handle the lines inside of the store, you might go crazy from the lines exiting the mall. Last visit, It took me over 20 minutes, sitting standstill in my car to leave. Of course this can be solved by visiting late on a weeknight, so I'll try that in the future.Good Costco, bad location."

This location offers a tire center, but not a gas station.The staff are professional, however they do make unprofessional comments if you are there around closing.I have never had that encounter before and was quite shocked.

Tiny C.,"Revere, MA",1,11/15/19,I went here to get a membership on Saturday and the man at the counter tried SO HARD to make me get the more expensive option. I know what I went in for (the basic $60 membership). Every time I tried to ask a question about the $60 membership he would say WELL THE $120 MEMBERSHIP IS A MUCH BETTER OPTION BECAUSE OF THE CASH BACK WHICH YOU END UP MAKING BACK THE DIFFERENCE...I didn't ask you though.

Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",4,11/8/18,"Going to Costco once a week seems like a good habit. The Everett Costco is so close to my home so that I end up going there sometimes more than once. What I like:- Great basic products of high quality. Milk, eggs, frozen edamame are usually in my cart.What I do not like:- Fruits and vegetables are of varying quality. One needs to check every item carefully. Even if Costco takes everything back that is not perfect, who would bother to return a box of oranges for one or two moldy ones?- Do not go on Saturdays, which I call Chinese carnival. When you see the lines of extended families craving free samples, you'd understand. It is great for them (and Costco), but not so great when you want to get in and out fast. Mondays are much faster."

The food counter at Cosco is also a bargain they serve up hotdogs and sausages like  it's nobody's business.  The dogs are large and juicy and you put on your own condiments.  The sausages are also large served on a sub roll with peppers and onions. They also serve up a few other fast food type items pizza chicken etc.  all priced less than if you bought anywhere else.  So next time you have a craving for a sausage or a dog go to Cisco food counter and spend $3-5 for some greatness in a bun.  Lol.  While your there you may as well get a years supply of something.  Hahaha.  Enjoy!!!
Megan H.,"Boston, MA",3,2/19/19,"I'm a big Costco fan, and I often visit this particular location. Like most Costcos, it gets insanely busy on the weekends, and the check-out lines seem to wrap around the store.Overall, the stock at this location is great. The food court is also good. The real trouble with this particular Costco is its location. It's situated in a busy strip mall, which seems to get busier each year. Even if you can handle the lines inside of the store, you might go crazy from the lines exiting the mall. Last visit, It took me over 20 minutes, sitting standstill in my car to leave. Of course this can be solved by visiting late on a weeknight, so I'll try that in the future.Good Costco, bad location."
Chuck J.,"Medford, MA",5,3/1/20,"We picked up the marinaded bulgogi on Feb 27, 2020.  First time we have seen it at Everett, MA. We've bought it in California Costco's before and it was ok.Costco in Everett got this bulgogi right on! Remember the white rice and kimchi.We'll buy it again."
Nichole J.,"Boston, MA",5,1/4/20,"Absolutely love Costco! My husband and I have been coming to Costco for years in the various cities we've in.They have a huge selection from food, home items, electronics, alcohol, medicine and more.Costco has their own brand called Kirkland which is amazing. This location offers a tire center, but not a gas station.The staff are professional, however they do make unprofessional comments if you are there around closing.I have never had that encounter before and was quite shocked. I understand if someone lingers since it is closing time, however do not make unprofessional comments and tell people to get out."
H Q.,"Malden, MA",1,10/13/19,"Very rude customer service & cashier !!!If you value ur membership fee that much, feel free to stop anyone without membership AT THE ENTRANCE. As a member, I refuse to bring you any potential customer, that's fair."
Tiny C.,"Revere, MA",1,11/15/19,I went here to get a membership on Saturday and the man at the counter tried SO HARD to make me get the more expensive option. I know what I went in for (the basic $60 membership). Every time I tried to ask a question about the $60 membership he would say WELL THE $120 MEMBERSHIP IS A MUCH BETTER OPTION BECAUSE OF THE CASH BACK WHICH YOU END UP MAKING BACK THE DIFFERENCE...I didn't ask you though. We went in circles about 5-7 times and I just decided to leave. BJs it is.
Willzyx Z.,"Boston, MA",5,5/16/19,"As of May 2019, this Costco is licensed to sell Costco alcohol. It's right on the main floor, next to underwear. The previous 3rd party store at Customer Service is now closed. Yes, they carry Kirkland French Vodka too."

Manfred S.,"Medford, MA",4,11/8/18,"Going to Costco once a week seems like a good habit. The Everett Costco is so close to my home so that I end up going there sometimes more than once. What I like:- Great basic products of high quality. Milk, eggs, frozen edamame are usually in my cart.What I do not like:- Fruits and vegetables are of varying quality. One needs to check every item carefully. Even if Costco takes everything back that is not perfect, who would bother to return a box of oranges for one or two moldy ones?- Do not go on Saturdays, which I call Chinese carnival. When you see the lines of extended families craving free samples, you'd understand. It is great for them (and Costco), but not so great when you want to get in and out fast. Mondays are much faster."
Yijiang Z.,"Columbus, IN",5,1/26/20,"Food is okay but very good for what you pay for. Additionally we fed 4 people with $12 which is insane, especially for Boston."
Roberta B.,"Winthrop, MA",1,11/2/19,20 minutes in a line that wraps around the building to do a return. Ridiculous. Why do I pay a fee to have to deal with this?The poor associate handling the entire situation was awesome. How about the management give her some support!
Wu W.,"Boston, MA",1,4/29/19,I bought 2 caesar salads from Costco. I found a moth in one of the salad. Ew..........Yuck!!!
Sharon V.,"Boston, MA",3,3/6/19,I really wasn't impressed with this location.  Compared to other Costcos this branch seemed small and had less inventory. It is close to Wellington and Assembly stations on the Orange line if you want to take a ride share over.   Restrooms needed attention.
Wing S.,"Norwich, CT",3,3/31/20,"This Costco store has a lot of Asian products than the other store which is the best part I like about it, but the worst part I didn't like about is that they don't have their gas station which they should have at this store because there are so many people here and also they have a Hugh parking lot outside which no one park by the entrance of the parking lot so they should build a gas station around there. And another thing is that one of their employees are so rude and strict, I went to the self check out line and I already have everything scan and ready to put my stuff back to my shopping cart, when I scan my stuff the cart was at the right side of the scanner machine, but after you scan your stuff you will need to put all your stuff to the left side where there a huge spot you needed to put your stuff each item after you scan. So when I was done scanning everything I pull the cart to the left side so I can easily put my stuff back to the cart but this employee keeps pulling my cart back to the other side where it was when I was start scanning my stuff so which I need to carry my stuff all the way to the other side and some items are heavy. So I told him can you please carry my stuff to my cart and he  ignore me."
Nikolai K.,"Waltham, MA",5,12/8/17,"This place is the illest.I'm genuinely never excited to go shopping more than when I'm en route to Costco. I will never turn down a chance to go. I wish people were more down to hang out here. I don't understand why people go hang at the mall, Costco is so much greater than that.There are always lots of samples. It's really fun to see what they have, and they rarely disappoint. The stations near the frozen food section are usually where the party's at.The prices are amazing. I got a pork loin for ~$3.50 which literally fed my family for almost a whole week. Wat.Of course there's loads of deals on other things too. Very good if you know what you enjoy eating even if you have a lot of it, and if you have ways to store it. Great value, and fantastic quality. The ratio cannot be beat.And of course the hot food is amazing and cheap. The combo pizza is great, super filling, the hot dogs are great, and the soft serve is huge."
Ziggy T.,"Boston, MA",1,10/16/19,"What a rude encounter I had with the cashier Jen this past weekend. A friend and I stopped in for a few things and decided to share a cart. We both had separate memberships and went to check out. We separated our purchases with the plastic divider, and both had our separate membership cards in hand. We noticed that when she got to the end of my purchase, she quickly removed the separator and continued scanning the items that my friend was purchasing. We politely mentioned that these were separate purchases. She rudely snapped back ""then you should've had your membership card on the belt"". No apology, no remorse, just condescendingly  talking down to us because we didn't do it her way. This lady needs to go back to customer service 101 and is not the way I expect to be treated at a place like a Costco."
Nathan L.,"Allston, MA",2,6/24/18,"I used to be a major Costco fan but I am continuously getting less and less so for the following reasons. -In the Boston area, Market Basket pricing on most items is competitive with Costco without requiring me to store ridiculously large quantities of stuff in my small apartment or buy a paid membership. -The rental car discounts are nice but I can get the same discount through USAA. -This location took over two hours to do the so called ""free"" tire rotation. It is not a ""free"" tire rotation. It is a service that I paid for as part of the original price of the tires I bought from a Costco. I keep my Costco membership only because the person who I has my second executive membership card spends a tremendous amount of money. The 2% rebate I get covers the cost of membership. The first year that doesn't happen, my membership will be cancelled. This year I didn't even have anything I wanted to spend the rebate certificate on so I went to the customer service counter and got cash."

W. B.,"Portsmouth, NH",5,10/4/20,"Another, consistently phenomenal experience as a customer of the Costco Everett Tire Center. Today, balance and rotate tires and wheels. The job was flawlessly done, and our car was returned clean, neat, the way I left it, and with no surprises (e.g. door dings, damage (as I've experienced at other businesses)). The staff were a pleasure to do business with. Due to Covid 19, there is no where to sit/wait, so you are relegated to the warehouse to shop/spend money (realize how much money you save, by shopping at Costco). Leave it to Diane in the Optical Department - - always gracious, helpful, knowledgable, and professional - - to help me find a new pair of eyeglasses."
Elaine C.,"Boston, MA",1,6/11/20,"I enjoy going to Costco. Less people than BJ's and I don't need to be carrying around coupons! If it's on sale, Costco will display it on their sign/prices.Due to COVID lines are a lot longer than usual, but I'm okay with that because I go in and get what I need and leave, NBD.I found everything I needed and was sent to a specific cashier and register.. I helped the cashier (Jennifer G) out by putting everything I can on the belt. I was using a different form of payment for a couple items and I asked for a separate receipt/transaction. Cashiers done it before, here at Costco and at other places, so I didn't think it was a big deal.. but apparently it was. The ""bagger,"" (which I caught her name) said thats fine when I asked her at first. Jennifer scanned the items and then stopped, but then started scanning everything else. I kindly asked if she can take the extra stuff she scanned off and she said, ""I already said you can't do that! It has to go on the same receipt, she already told you that!"" She was very rude and clearly did not care. I told her that's not what the bagger told me. The bagger came over and said it'll be on the same receipt but with a different subtotal. She explained that normally it can be done. I really appreciate the bagger explaining this to me, like I expressed to her. But Jennifer G needs to go stock or something. She is rude and has a nasty attitude for no reason, this is no way acceptable to be in the customer service field. This is the wrong job to you Jennifer G!"

Two young men checking us in with gloves and masks. I think they were counting us. Supplies were good. The meat counter was full. I find I shop a lot less if I do a big shopping here. I am grateful that they are doing so well for those of us who really try no to catch it.
J R.,"Quincy, MA",1,8/27/20,"Very disturbing to come to buy a membership from a deal on Groupon and very excited to see and start buying supplies and food from this Legacy Dedham location since the member buying the membership works and is an employee of Legacy Place. To Start off there was ONLY ONE CUSTOMER SERVICE GENTLEMAN working behind the counter helping a couple getting a joint membership. Unfortunately this transaction was so long for this couple but we stood patiently even though there were others ahead of us. Once we reached his counter and signed up was ready to joined on that account when it took a turn for the worse!!!! They wanted something with my address even though I told them I am a roommate and the person that signed up had all the bills under his name and would not add me to the account. The girl called the manager to see about getting me a membership even though no bills had my name and she came back and said he would not! She talked to us and said she was very sorry if it was up to her, she saw no problem with me getting a joint card living there even no bills came in my name!"" She was sorry and being disappointed we walked away so he could shop! We had to remind them for our free tote bag since it is auto renewal and yet no welcome coupon book! It was so much easier being a member at BJ's when we signed up!So, BEWARE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO SHARE A MEMBERSHIP AT COSTCO, they don't care if you live with the member for Over a Decade with out your name on any Utility Bills.Guess we will use this on a limited basis but since it actually cost nothing out of our pocket this year. We will cancel before renewal 2021.But, the employees at cashiers were all very nice and pleasant.My disappointment has reflected on Management who did not care to even come over and explain! But the employees apologized and saw no reason sharing a paid membership!"
Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,4/18/20,"They have Italian sausage sandwiches (like a hot dog) here.... how come we don't have this in California?! They smelled amazing, but we didn't want to spoil our appetites since we were heading to Boston for Neptunes Oyster. Selection was pretty widespread, and the layout was easy to comprehend. It was pretty busy when we came by on a Sunday afternoon, which is to be expected. Parking lot was big, and easy to find parking. It was kind of confusing figuring how to get to the actual Costco side of this plaza though. And so convenient that there's a parking structure nearby, too!"
Shanon B.,"Bristol, RI",5,8/27/20,"Haven't been to a Costco in such a long time bc there isn't over on Rhode Island, much to my dismay. But I went while in Boston the other day and it was so great to be back! Unfortunately they were out of toilet paper. But they had a great selection of organic ready-made meals and everything else you love Costco for. Staff was friendly and it wasn't too busy. Plenty of parking. Cheap gas! Nothing to complain about!"
Nancy H.,"Boston, MA",5,7/10/19,"Gas station, non-Costco affiliated liquor store, Legacy shops, and right off 95. This Costco is great. Self checkout if you only have a few items. Bakery needs 24 hour notice but the choice is between white or chocolate with a good layer of buttercream in the middle and some sort of whipped topping for $18.99, great when you need a simple cake to feed 48 people.I feel like this Costco offers a few different things than the Waltham branch in terms of snacks and desserts. However, everything else remains consistent from the rotisserie chicken to the baked goods.Go early or go late. If you go during the day or on the weekends you're bound to have a headache fighting the crowds. Plenty of parking. Condiment station tends to run out at the end of the day with no refill."
Rocky W.,"Boston, MA",5,12/11/19,"I love Costco! This is your typical location with full service optometry store, liquor store, bakery, food cafe, and photo store area. I recommend either coming here very early or late during the day near closing to beat the crowds or expect a long line when checking out and parking in the back of the parking lot. As an Asian-American I appreciate that this Costco has Asian products and merchandise during our holidays and especially around Chinese New Year. For example, they have Chinese sausage, Gingseng, and Jerky. This Costco is in a very prime in Dedham and it's very easy to access off the highway. Dedham seems a little far, but it's worth it because it's a very nice area! Right next door is Legacy Place which has a variety of upper end shopping and restaurants."
Katie H.,"Boston, MA",4,10/17/19,I have a love hate relationship with Costco. Love the prices and great products. But hate the crowds and having to store 50 rolls of paper towels. That being said.....I won't give up my membership. My SO is a bit of a dooms day food hoarder...so if the zombie apocalypse hits we will be set for some time with our food stock from Costco. 1. Avoid this place on the weekend at all costs. Go weekday morning if possible. 2. Have a plan to avoid overspending. 3. Skip your meal and just eat the samples.
Davis J.,"Batavia, NY",3,6/17/19,"I wish someone from Costco could tell me why they don't add more cashiers. Is it matte of space? Saving money? I don't know. But I know that the next time will see the crazy lines as they had here last weekend, I will leave everything and go. To have 12 people ahead of you is something that just make you wonder if you should come here again. That is it for complains, now to the better side of Costco. As I am moving to Providence, one of the stops is Costco (Home Depot experience on a different review). So saved a lot of money. I mean you can get things at the 99 stores for cheaper, but not even close to Costco quality. Also, discovered their $10 Caesars salad. Not bad at all! I got it for my sister who s into veg these days, and I almost ate all of it. Of course that one of their french Baguettes is also a plus."
Tim L.,"Boston, MA",3,6/8/20,"Costco always has great prices and quality.  But the people here, both customers and employees, need to learn manners. Shopping here is like going to the zoo.  Customers cutting in line and blocking aisles with carts. Rude employees with bad attitudes. Everyone here needs to take a deep breath and relax."
Xu X.,"Medford, MA",1,3/10/20,"I have been Costco members for years but today what happened in Dedham store make me cancel the membership without hesitation. First Costco supposed to be a wholesale store but when I checked out a person named Jean(assistant manager) and Scott( front manager) said there is limit on water, rice, paper towel, alcohol prep pad, every member can only buy two of each. When I asked them to show me a statement or notice , they just had very bad attitude said: we are representing costco to say that and all the people here to say that. What is even more shocking is the general manager there said , you don't need to be scared for the coronavirus, my son had the coronavirus and he recovered. Costco, really need to train their staff, not only bad attitude but also poor knowledge and scientific sense. Your team is pushing many customers away."
Venessa R.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",2,9/10/19,I love costco. This review is for this location only. This is the only location that gives me a hard time when my husband pays the bill. The membership card is in my name but hes my husband and I'm standing right next to him! No other location gives me such a hard time and I have been a Costco member for 3 years. I was literally embarrassed one day at the checkout because they declined his credit card. And by the way. When you pay self check out .. YOU CAN PAY WITH ANY CARD YOU WANT! Just makes no sense.
Mabel A.,"Lexington, MA",3,6/11/20,"I was at Costco Dedham just to return merchandise. There were 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return Merchandise counter. I had to ask for help 3 times before Jo came over. I walked into the store to ask to speak to a manager and Scott said he can help and I asked to speak to a manager. I do not know what did Scott speak to Tarrara, the manager, she came out with hands around her waist and was confrontational.  I just want to let her know that she does not need 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return merchandise counter.  All she really had to tell me was, "" I will talk to them"". Is that too hard?"

Zella B.,,3,9/14/19,"Not bad, humans just turn the place into trash. The anger in society is at an all time High. Lines exist for a reason, calm down. People are angry that they have to wait and angry that there is a line for gas. What is going to happen to this planet, only God knows. Costco needs to hire a security guard or police, it's getting insane. I find the zoo more peaceful, if the zoo opened a costco and I could shop with the animals, it would be a more human environment.  People need to get over themselves, u smell when u use the bathroom like everyone else and you die like everyone else, u are not more special despite what you like to think."
Matt D.,"Waltham, MA",5,12/7/17,"Always a fantastic value. The fuel station here is fantastic. It's modern, well lit, and the pumps are easy to operate.

Min C.,"Boston, MA",2,12/28/18,"Today is 12/28, traffic is herendous. I was at Costco gas station filling gas. The guy behind me came to tell me he was not Costco member but his gas was so low he worried he could not get to next gas station. I agreed to help him by using my card and he would give me cash. But the lady on duty came out of her booth in the rain to tell me absolutely not to lend me card, membership was not transferrable, etc. Apparently this guy had pleaded with her first but she refused him.I thought that was unnecessarily harsh especially during holiday season. Traffic was so bad the road going in and out of Costco was a sea of red lights. He could burn out his gas before the first traffic light. If she would allow me to help him with even $10 of gas, I am sure it would be a kinder, warmer better judgment callInstead, this cold damp winter day got chiller at Costco gas station"
Clare N.,"Newton, MA",4,12/31/18,"098 / 100 - 2018 YELP 100 CHALLENGE.I don't really understand why this Costco has such low ratings. It is exactly as you would expect it to be: Costco, the land of bulk goods with wholesale pricing.My only gripe with this location is the weird parking lot and the very, very bizarre layout of the store. Maybe I'm just used to way all the Costcos in California are laid out, but this one always throws me for a loop the moment I walk in. I feel like it should actually be flipped/mirrored. Like, the entrance is on the right side and not the left.Despite that, this Costco is pretty solid, even with all the crazy people who speed through the parking lot and seem to lose all capabilities of driving the moment they are within a half-mile radius of Costco. I don't get it. It's not like this is solely restricted to this particular Costco, it's seen in EVERY Costco parking lot.Employees here are, for the most part, friendly. I've run into a couple of cashiers who are not the nicest, but it's no big deal to me since I just want to get in and out anyway.There's tons of great selection here, lots to pick and choose from. They're always in stock with tons of things so you're bound to find what you're looking for. The store itself is also pretty clean (or as clean as it can be, considering the amount of foot traffic it sees!), which is an added bonus."
Hou Y.,"Allston/Brighton, Boston, MA",1,1/6/19,Staffing has attitude problems at the pizza and hotdog stand There was a African American guy who wears yellow shirt and I believe also speaks French He never talks to customer only point to tell ppl to pay then as soon as the transition is over he just walked away not even say a word.Come on . Need at least some basic custom skills
Jeff C.,"Millis, MA",1,1/5/19,I have no coming to this Costco  at least 10 years now never had an issue until today not only did I spend 40 minutes trying to park there I go inside do my shopping wait in line another 20 minutes to get to the counter and for them to tell me my membership needs to be renewed not prepared for the membership fee today the manager precedes to tell me you cannot shop until you renew your membership which expired 4 days agoSo much for being a loyal customer these days I will be renewing my membership at BJ's Wholesale Club
Linda A.,"Boston, MA",3,7/30/18,"It's a Costco.  Bulk goods, long lines and no bags.  The parking lot is generally packed and gas station too.  Once you get inside the only place I really have experienced congestion is the cold foods section.  Some Kirkland products are amazing, I think we use the butter, honey, and cleaning products daily but some are duds.  I'm looking at you toilet paper.  They do guarantee, but when you see the length of the customer service line it's enough of a deterrent to make that policy really useful.  Customer service is ok,  haven't really had a cashier who smiled or returned small talk but to be fair, maybe that's just their disposition.All in all, it is what it is, a popular (read:crowded) bulk good membership only warehouse."
Sue W.,"Falmouth, MA",5,6/15/20,This is our second Covid visit to Costco this spring. I was very pleased. They all wear masks. There is plastic shielding at checkout. There were wipes available. Two young men checking us in with gloves and masks. I think they were counting us. Supplies were good. The meat counter was full. I find I shop a lot less if I do a big shopping here. I am grateful that they are doing so well for those of us who really try no to catch it.
J R.,"Quincy, MA",1,8/27/20,"Very disturbing to come to buy a membership from a deal on Groupon and very excited to see and start buying supplies and food from this Legacy Dedham location since the member buying the membership works and is an employee of Legacy Place. To Start off there was ONLY ONE CUSTOMER SERVICE GENTLEMAN working behind the counter helping a couple getting a joint membership. Unfortunately this transaction was so long for this couple but we stood patiently even though there were others ahead of us. Once we reached his counter and signed up was ready to joined on that account when it took a turn for the worse!!!! They wanted something with my address even though I told them I am a roommate and the person that signed up had all the bills under his name and would not add me to the account. The girl called the manager to see about getting me a membership even though no bills had my name and she came back and said he would not! She talked to us and said she was very sorry if it was up to her, she saw no problem with me getting a joint card living there even no bills came in my name!"" She was sorry and being disappointed we walked away so he could shop! We had to remind them for our free tote bag since it is auto renewal and yet no welcome coupon book! It was so much easier being a member at BJ's when we signed up!So, BEWARE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO SHARE A MEMBERSHIP AT COSTCO, they don't care if you live with the member for Over a Decade with out your name on any Utility Bills.Guess we will use this on a limited basis but since it actually cost nothing out of our pocket this year. We will cancel before renewal 2021.But, the employees at cashiers were all very nice and pleasant.My disappointment has reflected on Management who did not care to even come over and explain! But the employees apologized and saw no reason sharing a paid membership!"
Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,4/18/20,"They have Italian sausage sandwiches (like a hot dog) here.... how come we don't have this in California?! They smelled amazing, but we didn't want to spoil our appetites since we were heading to Boston for Neptunes Oyster. Selection was pretty widespread, and the layout was easy to comprehend. It was pretty busy when we came by on a Sunday afternoon, which is to be expected. Parking lot was big, and easy to find parking. It was kind of confusing figuring how to get to the actual Costco side of this plaza though. And so convenient that there's a parking structure nearby, too!"
Shanon B.,"Bristol, RI",5,8/27/20,"Haven't been to a Costco in such a long time bc there isn't over on Rhode Island, much to my dismay. But I went while in Boston the other day and it was so great to be back! Unfortunately they were out of toilet paper. But they had a great selection of organic ready-made meals and everything else you love Costco for. Staff was friendly and it wasn't too busy. Plenty of parking. Cheap gas! Nothing to complain about!"
Nancy H.,"Boston, MA",5,7/10/19,"Gas station, non-Costco affiliated liquor store, Legacy shops, and right off 95. This Costco is great. Self checkout if you only have a few items. Bakery needs 24 hour notice but the choice is between white or chocolate with a good layer of buttercream in the middle and some sort of whipped topping for $18.99, great when you need a simple cake to feed 48 people.I feel like this Costco offers a few different things than the Waltham branch in terms of snacks and desserts. However, everything else remains consistent from the rotisserie chicken to the baked goods.Go early or go late. If you go during the day or on the weekends you're bound to have a headache fighting the crowds. Plenty of parking. Condiment station tends to run out at the end of the day with no refill."
Rocky W.,"Boston, MA",5,12/11/19,"I love Costco! This is your typical location with full service optometry store, liquor store, bakery, food cafe, and photo store area. I recommend either coming here very early or late during the day near closing to beat the crowds or expect a long line when checking out and parking in the back of the parking lot. As an Asian-American I appreciate that this Costco has Asian products and merchandise during our holidays and especially around Chinese New Year. For example, they have Chinese sausage, Gingseng, and Jerky. This Costco is in a very prime in Dedham and it's very easy to access off the highway. Dedham seems a little far, but it's worth it because it's a very nice area! Right next door is Legacy Place which has a variety of upper end shopping and restaurants."
Katie H.,"Boston, MA",4,10/17/19,I have a love hate relationship with Costco. Love the prices and great products. But hate the crowds and having to store 50 rolls of paper towels. That being said.....I won't give up my membership. My SO is a bit of a dooms day food hoarder...so if the zombie apocalypse hits we will be set for some time with our food stock from Costco. 1. Avoid this place on the weekend at all costs. Go weekday morning if possible. 2. Have a plan to avoid overspending. 3. Skip your meal and just eat the samples.
Davis J.,"Batavia, NY",3,6/17/19,"I wish someone from Costco could tell me why they don't add more cashiers. Is it matte of space? Saving money? I don't know. But I know that the next time will see the crazy lines as they had here last weekend, I will leave everything and go. To have 12 people ahead of you is something that just make you wonder if you should come here again. That is it for complains, now to the better side of Costco. As I am moving to Providence, one of the stops is Costco (Home Depot experience on a different review). So saved a lot of money. I mean you can get things at the 99 stores for cheaper, but not even close to Costco quality. Also, discovered their $10 Caesars salad. Not bad at all! I got it for my sister who s into veg these days, and I almost ate all of it. Of course that one of their french Baguettes is also a plus."
Tim L.,"Boston, MA",3,6/8/20,"Costco always has great prices and quality.  But the people here, both customers and employees, need to learn manners. Shopping here is like going to the zoo.  Customers cutting in line and blocking aisles with carts. Rude employees with bad attitudes. Everyone here needs to take a deep breath and relax."
Xu X.,"Medford, MA",1,3/10/20,"I have been Costco members for years but today what happened in Dedham store make me cancel the membership without hesitation. First Costco supposed to be a wholesale store but when I checked out a person named Jean(assistant manager) and Scott( front manager) said there is limit on water, rice, paper towel, alcohol prep pad, every member can only buy two of each. When I asked them to show me a statement or notice , they just had very bad attitude said: we are representing costco to say that and all the people here to say that. What is even more shocking is the general manager there said , you don't need to be scared for the coronavirus, my son had the coronavirus and he recovered. Costco, really need to train their staff, not only bad attitude but also poor knowledge and scientific sense. Your team is pushing many customers away."
Venessa R.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",2,9/10/19,I love costco. This review is for this location only. This is the only location that gives me a hard time when my husband pays the bill. The membership card is in my name but hes my husband and I'm standing right next to him! No other location gives me such a hard time and I have been a Costco member for 3 years. I was literally embarrassed one day at the checkout because they declined his credit card. And by the way. When you pay self check out .. YOU CAN PAY WITH ANY CARD YOU WANT! Just makes no sense.
Mabel A.,"Lexington, MA",3,6/11/20,"I was at Costco Dedham just to return merchandise. There were 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return Merchandise counter. I had to ask for help 3 times before Jo came over. I walked into the store to ask to speak to a manager and Scott said he can help and I asked to speak to a manager. I do not know what did Scott speak to Tarrara, the manager, she came out with hands around her waist and was confrontational.  I just want to let her know that she does not need 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return merchandise counter.  All she really had to tell me was, "" I will talk to them"". Is that too hard?"

Jeff C.,"Millis, MA",1,1/5/19,I have no coming to this Costco  at least 10 years now never had an issue until today not only did I spend 40 minutes trying to park there I go inside do my shopping wait in line another 20 minutes to get to the counter and for them to tell me my membership needs to be renewed not prepared for the membership fee today the manager precedes to tell me you cannot shop until you renew your membership which expired 4 days agoSo much for being a loyal customer these days I will be renewing my membership at BJ's Wholesale Club
Linda A.,"Boston, MA",3,7/30/18,"It's a Costco.  Bulk goods, long lines and no bags.  The parking lot is generally packed and gas station too.  Once you get inside the only place I really have experienced congestion is the cold foods section.  Some Kirkland products are amazing, I think we use the butter, honey, and cleaning products daily but some are duds.  I'm looking at you toilet paper.  They do guarantee, but when you see the length of the customer service line it's enough of a deterrent to make that policy really useful.  Customer service is ok,  haven't really had a cashier who smiled or returned small talk but to be fair, maybe that's just their disposition.All in all, it is what it is, a popular (read:crowded) bulk good membership only warehouse."
Sue W.,"Falmouth, MA",5,6/15/20,This is our second Covid visit to Costco this spring. I was very pleased. They all wear masks. There is plastic shielding at checkout. There were wipes available. Two young men checking us in with gloves and masks. I think they were counting us. Supplies were good. The meat counter was full. I find I shop a lot less if I do a big shopping here. I am grateful that they are doing so well for those of us who really try no to catch it.
J R.,"Quincy, MA",1,8/27/20,"Very disturbing to come to buy a membership from a deal on Groupon and very excited to see and start buying supplies and food from this Legacy Dedham location since the member buying the membership works and is an employee of Legacy Place. To Start off there was ONLY ONE CUSTOMER SERVICE GENTLEMAN working behind the counter helping a couple getting a joint membership. Unfortunately this transaction was so long for this couple but we stood patiently even though there were others ahead of us. Once we reached his counter and signed up was ready to joined on that account when it took a turn for the worse!!!! They wanted something with my address even though I told them I am a roommate and the person that signed up had all the bills under his name and would not add me to the account. The girl called the manager to see about getting me a membership even though no bills had my name and she came back and said he would not! She talked to us and said she was very sorry if it was up to her, she saw no problem with me getting a joint card living there even no bills came in my name!"" She was sorry and being disappointed we walked away so he could shop! We had to remind them for our free tote bag since it is auto renewal and yet no welcome coupon book! It was so much easier being a member at BJ's when we signed up!So, BEWARE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO SHARE A MEMBERSHIP AT COSTCO, they don't care if you live with the member for Over a Decade with out your name on any Utility Bills.Guess we will use this on a limited basis but since it actually cost nothing out of our pocket this year. We will cancel before renewal 2021.But, the employees at cashiers were all very nice and pleasant.My disappointment has reflected on Management who did not care to even come over and explain! But the employees apologized and saw no reason sharing a paid membership!"
Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,4/18/20,"They have Italian sausage sandwiches (like a hot dog) here.... how come we don't have this in California?! They smelled amazing, but we didn't want to spoil our appetites since we were heading to Boston for Neptunes Oyster. Selection was pretty widespread, and the layout was easy to comprehend. It was pretty busy when we came by on a Sunday afternoon, which is to be expected. Parking lot was big, and easy to find parking. It was kind of confusing figuring how to get to the actual Costco side of this plaza though. And so convenient that there's a parking structure nearby, too!"
Shanon B.,"Bristol, RI",5,8/27/20,"Haven't been to a Costco in such a long time bc there isn't over on Rhode Island, much to my dismay. But I went while in Boston the other day and it was so great to be back! Unfortunately they were out of toilet paper. But they had a great selection of organic ready-made meals and everything else you love Costco for. Staff was friendly and it wasn't too busy. Plenty of parking. Cheap gas! Nothing to complain about!"
Nancy H.,"Boston, MA",5,7/10/19,"Gas station, non-Costco affiliated liquor store, Legacy shops, and right off 95. This Costco is great. Self checkout if you only have a few items. Bakery needs 24 hour notice but the choice is between white or chocolate with a good layer of buttercream in the middle and some sort of whipped topping for $18.99, great when you need a simple cake to feed 48 people.I feel like this Costco offers a few different things than the Waltham branch in terms of snacks and desserts. However, everything else remains consistent from the rotisserie chicken to the baked goods.Go early or go late. If you go during the day or on the weekends you're bound to have a headache fighting the crowds. Plenty of parking. Condiment station tends to run out at the end of the day with no refill."
Rocky W.,"Boston, MA",5,12/11/19,"I love Costco! This is your typical location with full service optometry store, liquor store, bakery, food cafe, and photo store area. I recommend either coming here very early or late during the day near closing to beat the crowds or expect a long line when checking out and parking in the back of the parking lot. As an Asian-American I appreciate that this Costco has Asian products and merchandise during our holidays and especially around Chinese New Year. For example, they have Chinese sausage, Gingseng, and Jerky. This Costco is in a very prime in Dedham and it's very easy to access off the highway. Dedham seems a little far, but it's worth it because it's a very nice area! Right next door is Legacy Place which has a variety of upper end shopping and restaurants."
Katie H.,"Boston, MA",4,10/17/19,I have a love hate relationship with Costco. Love the prices and great products. But hate the crowds and having to store 50 rolls of paper towels. That being said.....I won't give up my membership. My SO is a bit of a dooms day food hoarder...so if the zombie apocalypse hits we will be set for some time with our food stock from Costco. 1. Avoid this place on the weekend at all costs. Go weekday morning if possible. 2. Have a plan to avoid overspending. 3. Skip your meal and just eat the samples.
Davis J.,"Batavia, NY",3,6/17/19,"I wish someone from Costco could tell me why they don't add more cashiers. Is it matte of space? Saving money? I don't know. But I know that the next time will see the crazy lines as they had here last weekend, I will leave everything and go. To have 12 people ahead of you is something that just make you wonder if you should come here again. That is it for complains, now to the better side of Costco. As I am moving to Providence, one of the stops is Costco (Home Depot experience on a different review). So saved a lot of money. I mean you can get things at the 99 stores for cheaper, but not even close to Costco quality. Also, discovered their $10 Caesars salad. Not bad at all! I got it for my sister who s into veg these days, and I almost ate all of it. Of course that one of their french Baguettes is also a plus."
Tim L.,"Boston, MA",3,6/8/20,"Costco always has great prices and quality.  But the people here, both customers and employees, need to learn manners. Shopping here is like going to the zoo.  Customers cutting in line and blocking aisles with carts. Rude employees with bad attitudes. Everyone here needs to take a deep breath and relax."
Xu X.,"Medford, MA",1,3/10/20,"I have been Costco members for years but today what happened in Dedham store make me cancel the membership without hesitation. First Costco supposed to be a wholesale store but when I checked out a person named Jean(assistant manager) and Scott( front manager) said there is limit on water, rice, paper towel, alcohol prep pad, every member can only buy two of each. When I asked them to show me a statement or notice , they just had very bad attitude said: we are representing costco to say that and all the people here to say that. What is even more shocking is the general manager there said , you don't need to be scared for the coronavirus, my son had the coronavirus and he recovered. Costco, really need to train their staff, not only bad attitude but also poor knowledge and scientific sense. Your team is pushing many customers away."
Venessa R.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",2,9/10/19,I love costco. This review is for this location only. This is the only location that gives me a hard time when my husband pays the bill. The membership card is in my name but hes my husband and I'm standing right next to him! No other location gives me such a hard time and I have been a Costco member for 3 years. I was literally embarrassed one day at the checkout because they declined his credit card. And by the way. When you pay self check out .. YOU CAN PAY WITH ANY CARD YOU WANT! Just makes no sense.
Mabel A.,"Lexington, MA",3,6/11/20,"I was at Costco Dedham just to return merchandise. There were 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return Merchandise counter. I had to ask for help 3 times before Jo came over. I walked into the store to ask to speak to a manager and Scott said he can help and I asked to speak to a manager. I do not know what did Scott speak to Tarrara, the manager, she came out with hands around her waist and was confrontational.  I just want to let her know that she does not need 3 staffs at the New Membership counter and none at the Return merchandise counter.  All she really had to tell me was, "" I will talk to them"". Is that too hard?"
Emalotty L.,"Boston, MA",5,6/5/20,"I love this Costco. My fiancé and I drive here from Quincy because the team here is so friendly, professional and helpful! HUGE shout out to SCOTT! Who seems like he was born to help and genuinely enjoys his staff.. another shout out to Chris and George... also Cecelia who was the lovely woman who answered my call and got me in touch with Scott. I can't say enough how great I think the people who work here are. Wonderful all around !"
Zella B.,,3,9/14/19,"Not bad, humans just turn the place into trash. The anger in society is at an all time High. Lines exist for a reason, calm down. People are angry that they have to wait and angry that there is a line for gas. What is going to happen to this planet, only God knows. Costco needs to hire a security guard or police, it's getting insane. I find the zoo more peaceful, if the zoo opened a costco and I could shop with the animals, it would be a more human environment.  People need to get over themselves, u smell when u use the bathroom like everyone else and you die like everyone else, u are not more special despite what you like to think."
Matt D.,"Waltham, MA",5,12/7/17,"Always a fantastic value. The fuel station here is fantastic. It's modern, well lit, and the pumps are easy to operate.

Min C.,"Boston, MA",2,12/28/18,"Today is 12/28, traffic is herendous. I was at Costco gas station filling gas. The guy behind me came to tell me he was not Costco member but his gas was so low he worried he could not get to next gas station. I agreed to help him by using my card and he would give me cash. But the lady on duty came out of her booth in the rain to tell me absolutely not to lend me card, membership was not transferrable, etc. Apparently this guy had pleaded with her first but she refused him.I thought that was unnecessarily harsh especially during holiday season. Traffic was so bad the road going in and out of Costco was a sea of red lights. He could burn out his gas before the first traffic light. If she would allow me to help him with even $10 of gas, I am sure it would be a kinder, warmer better judgment callInstead, this cold damp winter day got chiller at Costco gas station"

It is exactly as you would expect it to be: Costco, the land of bulk goods with wholesale pricing.My only gripe with this location is the weird parking lot and the very, very bizarre layout of the store. Maybe I'm just used to way all the Costcos in California are laid out, but this one always throws me for a loop the moment I walk in. I feel like it should actually be flipped/mirrored. Like, the entrance is on the right side and not the left.Despite that, this Costco is pretty solid, even with all the crazy people who speed through the parking lot and seem to lose all capabilities of driving the moment they are within a half-mile radius of Costco. I don't get it. It's not like this is solely restricted to this particular Costco, it's seen in EVERY Costco parking lot.Employees here are, for the most part, friendly. I've run into a couple of cashiers who are not the nicest, but it's no big deal to me since I just want to get in and out anyway.There's tons of great selection here, lots to pick and choose from.

J R.,"Quincy, MA",4,9/30/20,"Today was a good day to shop! I don't know why you have to show your membership when you walk in I think it is counter productive to waste an employee at the entrance seeing that you have a card! Don't they realize that you can't go thur a cashier without a valid Costco card? Yes having you items checked when leaving is great I noticed at times some parents allow their children to open candy bags while shopping that's a big issue for me that no one should take without paying first. But such a huge store and employees at times are scarce! But, I like the store but wonder in the Dairy section there is NO FAT FREE MILK JUST 1+ 2% + Whole is for sale not FAT FREE! BJS has Fat Free plus I only Notice Splenda in packets not lose like everywhere else.Just some differences I notice each time I go."
Sue W.,"Falmouth, MA",3,4/30/20,We went to senior hours this week. We thought one big trip to last many weeks would be good. I was very pleased. They wiped every cart as we entered. Everyone needs a mask. Two people toa cart. A few things were limited. Most things were well stocked. Some meat seemed bigger than ever. Maybe packing plant problems. All staff seemed well trained and serious about cleaning and disinfecting. The checkout was shielded and distance was maintained. A staffer checked us out but eyed the basket instead of touching things. We will continue distancing whether the ban is lifted or not and are now set to do so.
Kevin M.,"Providence, RI",5,4/4/20,"What you pay for in an annual membership you'll get back with great deals and quality.Tires are a great deal. Great prices on spirits, seasonal items are always well displayed and easy to find. Plenty of parking and a staff of great people, always ready to help."
Anna C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,12/30/19,"Review for the food court: The food here was somehow better than your average Costco. The acai was very smooth - not icy as I'm used to - and they were super generous with the granola and diced fruits.

Charles H.,"Queens, NY",5,5/25/19,"5 stars to this Costco. Why? Because my visit (Thursday 5-16-2019) was a visit I always wanted my visits to Costco to be like. Starting from parking. Easy and a great spot. To the shopping. Fresh beautiful flowers and someone to help on almost every department. Now to the check out. It is usually something that get my last drop of energy but not this time. Only one shopper ahead of me. So, had extra 15 minutes. What is better than a good hot dog. Not a big fan of Costco food. Usually taste better than how (if at all) healthy. But this time it came perfectly. A good shopping experience."
Sharon V.,"Boston, MA",4,2/1/19,Costco is a magical land of free samples on the weekend.  Last weekend I sampled seaweed and sausages.  You just can't ask for a better weekend...lol.   My fav items are Costco are their prepared chicken.  For $4.99 it fed my boyfriend's parents and we had some left overs to make sandwiches and chicken soup.  You just can't go wrong.   We also think the Kirkland brand paper towels are a great deal. We really love the big hunk of Kerry's Gold Chedder cheese for under $10.00 this cheese will last us about a month.  O-M-G the food court type restaurant has really good pizza and frozen yogurt.  I really wish they had a bigger parking lot as parking can be tight on the weekend.
Bill L.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,12/30/17,"I'm not a member of Costco but enjoyed my recent visit over the holidays. Theres a greeter at the front door to verify your membership. Once inside we grabbed a cart and off we went. First stop, the wine and liquor section. Great variety of all the top bottles I'm accustomed to buying elsewhere and the prices were great. Kallua, Prosecco, Captain Morgan's, Josh, etc. We filled up a case, lol.Next we cruised passed the electronics section but not without noticing some super deals on hot brands like Samsung, Bose, Beats, Xbox and more.On to the food section while we sampled bites of all sorts of stuff like lobster dip, cheesecake, tiramisu, cheeses and more. We filled the cart with scallops, orange juice, fresh fruits, crackers, prime rib, cereal, nuts and plenty of other stuff I'm sure we didn't need.Off to the checkout. In under 30 minutes we managed to spend over $200 but overall the experience was enjoyable. I'm rethinking the membership now."
Krys G.,"St. Augustine, FL",5,3/7/17,"We are two crazy people who love shopping at Costco! There is plenty of parking out front. This Costco has a small car garage on the side. The mechanics are always willing to help us when  we swing by to get our tires checked. They never charge us either. Big plus in my books!  I think it's ridiculous showing your card when you walk in. A hassle they could eliminate. You can just show your card when you pay. This store sells wine! They usually have an interesting selection. The bakery section is always busy with new items showing up every now and again.  The meat section is great too. Always fresh and they do take special orders if you ask.  They have fresh fish and seafood too. We have been addicted to the haddock and salmon when they get it in.  They have a great selection of cheeses too. The best deal is the rotisserie chickens only $4.99.  There is also a ready made section full of prepared foods, just heat and serve. We take advantage of the pharmacy at this location. It's cheaper than most drug stores. Only thing to keep in mind is that they are closed on Sundays.  The pharmacy staff are very friendly and helpful. There was a cranky lady working there that I haven't seen in a while.  LOL  There is also a hearing aide place next to the pharmacy.We love the walk in cold fridge full of fresh produce. You really can't go wrong with most of the produce. Just check the expiry dates on the packages...even if you have to dig three boxes down like we do. There are always samples and I'm talking big samples. You could have quite a nice afternoon snack if you time it right!  Or you could just go to the cafe and get yourself a hotdog and drink for next to nothing.  I love the chicken Caesar salad for $3.99. Besides all the food items there are clothes, shoes, furniture, home decor, jewelry electronics...if you need it, you will probably find it here! I have also ordered online and have had great success!"
Alice L.,"Arlington, MA",5,1/9/18,"Yes yes yes!! Why you should come to this Costco: - Parking is a breeze and spots are roomy. - Items are always stocked. - Costco liquor store (not privately owned), stock up on that Kirkland sangria!- Updated checkout lanes, 6 stations rather than 2. - Less crowded than Dedham location."
Raii T.,"Boston, MA",4,7/3/19,"Sign up, you will not regret it! First off, they feed you with with tasty samples.  The staff members are really friendly. Clean, spacious, no hassle.  Bathrooms are very clean. Be weary of the some of the older women who give out samples, they can be rude, or have an attitude.  A mom asked one for just a cracker for her baby and she refused.  Just give the baby the cracker even though you're serving salmon. No 5 year old wants raw salmon, unless you're a baby bear. Silly! I avoid her like the plague but overall great place. 1 star taken off for crazy, server lady!"
Beverly B.,"Boston, MA",2,12/21/18,Need to tell people as they come in alcohol needs to be purchased at registers with everything else. Went and shopped and came back to buy liquor only told then that I need to leave my cart at the beginning of the liquor store and get my alcohol purchased and then I can get my cart with my other purchases back. Please consider being more efficient and communicate this at the BEGINNING  of the shopping experience especially with your members!
Erin C.,"East Bridgewater, MA",2,11/8/18,"Placed on order online. Accepted a 5% surcharge because my membership had expired.  I had successfully done this in the past. Costco canceled the order. After many phone calls, Costco informed me that I wasn't allowed to place an order online unless I renewed my membership. We don't make it to to the warehouse enough to justify a $50 renewal fee and would have gladly paid the surcharge and kept spending hundreds at Costco online. It felt a little bit like they were strong-arming us into renewing. I told them I'd rather not, especially because BJs has waived membership fees starting on Nov 1.  BJs also offers online ordering. Happy to take our money elsewhere."
Melissa R.,"Canton, MA",1,9/11/17,"After waiting 15+ mins for someone to come out from the customer service desk to empty the full can/bottle machines even after they were told someone was waiting was the last straw for me. I'm done with them. It already boggled the mind that you need a chart to decipher what the aisle numbers represent, because they don't have clear signage with the general types of items on each aisle. This company doesn't have a customer-focused model. With a few changes they could be better...ensuring that can/bottle returns are emptied at the end of each day, putting in clear signage on the aisles, etc."
Opal D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,4/6/19,"Costco is great. It can get a little hectic here, especially when they're giving out food samples and people abandon their carts in the middle of  high traffic aisles just to go grab a sample ~ but otherwise they have good products at good prices."

Juliana C.,"Toronto, Canada",5,10/12/16,"Flowers were low on my list of wedding priorities - I just couldn't justify spending a fortune on something that wouldn't last past the weekend. Fortunately, there was a Costco near our venue that offered tailored centerpieces - we're talking roses, daisies, leaves and baby's breath AND a trendy square vase - at $20 apiece.I'll admit I was a little skeptical about what quality I could expect for such a low price, but that skepticism allowed me to be bowled over by my order. In between picking up the centerpieces at Costco and shopping for additional wedding supplies, I was stopped by no less than five people asking what aisle I had gotten the flowers from, and how much they cost.The bouquets lasted overnight in the basement of our venue, throughout our 3 pm - midnight reception, and still looked perky the next day. I can't speak highly enough about the value and ease of ordering! For brides on a budget, Costco's flower selection is a godsend."
Marlena V.,"Providence, RI",3,7/19/15,"Since I don't live anywhere near the general vicinity of Costco, the supreme budget shopper in me was dying to try it out after an IKEA trip.  Since Costco is constantly raved and praised by lit. everyone I know (especially their locations in Japan) I was ready to check out the hype machine and take a look around.It was alright.I was disappointed right off the bat to find out that unlike other wholesale chains that they don't offer a trial membership.  Since we were traveling back and forth to IKEA for a big project I was ready to jump on the opportunity and make some purchases.  Alas, it was not to be.After looking at prices and the food varieties they offered, I really wasn't blown away.  Most, if not all of the prices I looked at in their meat department were comparable or in a couple cases, more, than what I normally pay at my local stores.  Granted I live out of state and for all I know, the prices may generally be more than where I live so in that regard, I give them the benefit of the doubt.The rest of their snacks, canned goods, pasta, etc were also generally the same deal as the meat.  I spied a very large box of morning blueberry biscuits the hubby loves for about $10: I had purchased the same bulk box in the same variety a couple weeks before at my local Job Lot for $4.99.  I honestly didn't find a single deal that blew me away.I will however, give them the 3 stars for their AMAZING snack bar.  $1.50 for a giant hot dog with all the fixins?  YES PLEASE.  Their ice cream sundaes are also equally amazing.Overall, I suppose I can see the appeal depending on local prices.  I for one, have always preferred to shop around to find discounts so someplace like Costco isn't really for me.I do give them huge props for treating their employees well!"
Alex C.,"Boston, MA",5,4/18/13,"Better living with CostcoFor all those who have never stepped foot inside a Costco because of a fear of bulk packaging  or concrete floors, let me share some secrets.  Costco does two things well that really set it apart from the other big box stores: quality product selection and margin cost pricing.  If margin cost pricing brings flashbacks of sweaty college final exams for you, relax: I was an economics major and can guide you through this one.  Costco adds a relatively low percentage over its costs when pricing the goods it sells.  That's it.  It does not try to get the highest dollar or ""market"" price, and the results are much lower overall prices.  And Costco applies this policy to name brand, quality products and you enjoy the benefits.  The result, for example, is that you can buy a fantastic bottle of 2010 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir for $23 that the wine shop down the street carries for $36.  Look at the jewelry case and find Michelle watches for hundreds of dollars less than elsewhere.   And that Pinot Noir and Michelle watches bring up the second point: Costco does a lot of the product selection for you before something hits the shelves, so you won't be confronted with dozens of different choices leaving you feeling slightly flummoxed about which product to buy, maybe a little unsure that you purchased the ""right"" one after you leave and certainly wasting your time in the process.  Instead, Costco puts excellent products on its shelves and in its refrigerated cases with somewhat limited choices, and when you put something in your cart there is a high degree of confidence that you will be happy with your purchase when you get home.  And if not, Costco will just as happily refund your money.  In years shopping there, I have never had a problem returning anything.   Among the things you may not have been expecting to find at Costco: roses, meats, fresh fish, cheese, fruits (huge pineapples for a couple of bucks), and rotisserie chickens (which are large and simply delicious).  There are also slowly rotating seasonal items, along with all the staples.  So, lots of toys around Christmas, replaced by furniture after the holidays, outdoor living gear in late spring, etc.  Every Costco is a little different, and the best way to see if you actually like your nearest one is to grab one of those oversized shopping carts and take the plunge.   You'll find me in front of the King Crab display with a couple bottles of a nice German Riesling in my cart."
J R.,"Quincy, MA",4,9/30/20,"Today was a good day to shop! I don't know why you have to show your membership when you walk in I think it is counter productive to waste an employee at the entrance seeing that you have a card! Don't they realize that you can't go thur a cashier without a valid Costco card? Yes having you items checked when leaving is great I noticed at times some parents allow their children to open candy bags while shopping that's a big issue for me that no one should take without paying first. But such a huge store and employees at times are scarce! But, I like the store but wonder in the Dairy section there is NO FAT FREE MILK JUST 1+ 2% + Whole is for sale not FAT FREE!

Bill L.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,12/30/17,"I'm not a member of Costco but enjoyed my recent visit over the holidays. Theres a greeter at the front door to verify your membership. Once inside we grabbed a cart and off we went. First stop, the wine and liquor section. Great variety of all the top bottles I'm accustomed to buying elsewhere and the prices were great. Kallua, Prosecco, Captain Morgan's, Josh, etc. We filled up a case, lol.Next we cruised passed the electronics section but not without noticing some super deals on hot brands like Samsung, Bose, Beats, Xbox and more.On to the food section while we sampled bites of all sorts of stuff like lobster dip, cheesecake, tiramisu, cheeses and more. We filled the cart with scallops, orange juice, fresh fruits, crackers, prime rib, cereal, nuts and plenty of other stuff I'm sure we didn't need.Off to the checkout. In under 30 minutes we managed to spend over $200 but overall the experience was enjoyable. I'm rethinking the membership now."
Krys G.,"St. Augustine, FL",5,3/7/17,"We are two crazy people who love shopping at Costco! There is plenty of parking out front. This Costco has a small car garage on the side. The mechanics are always willing to help us when  we swing by to get our tires checked. They never charge us either. Big plus in my books!  I think it's ridiculous showing your card when you walk in. A hassle they could eliminate. You can just show your card when you pay. This store sells wine! They usually have an interesting selection. The bakery section is always busy with new items showing up every now and again.  The meat section is great too. Always fresh and they do take special orders if you ask.  They have fresh fish and seafood too. We have been addicted to the haddock and salmon when they get it in.  They have a great selection of cheeses too. The best deal is the rotisserie chickens only $4.99.  There is also a ready made section full of prepared foods, just heat and serve. We take advantage of the pharmacy at this location. It's cheaper than most drug stores. Only thing to keep in mind is that they are closed on Sundays.  The pharmacy staff are very friendly and helpful. There was a cranky lady working there that I haven't seen in a while.  LOL  There is also a hearing aide place next to the pharmacy.We love the walk in cold fridge full of fresh produce. You really can't go wrong with most of the produce. Just check the expiry dates on the packages...even if you have to dig three boxes down like we do. There are always samples and I'm talking big samples. You could have quite a nice afternoon snack if you time it right!  Or you could just go to the cafe and get yourself a hotdog and drink for next to nothing.  I love the chicken Caesar salad for $3.99. Besides all the food items there are clothes, shoes, furniture, home decor, jewelry electronics...if you need it, you will probably find it here! I have also ordered online and have had great success!"
Alice L.,"Arlington, MA",5,1/9/18,"Yes yes yes!! Why you should come to this Costco: - Parking is a breeze and spots are roomy. - Items are always stocked. - Costco liquor store (not privately owned), stock up on that Kirkland sangria!- Updated checkout lanes, 6 stations rather than 2. - Less crowded than Dedham location."
Raii T.,"Boston, MA",4,7/3/19,"Sign up, you will not regret it! First off, they feed you with with tasty samples.  The staff members are really friendly. Clean, spacious, no hassle.  Bathrooms are very clean. Be weary of the some of the older women who give out samples, they can be rude, or have an attitude.  A mom asked one for just a cracker for her baby and she refused.  Just give the baby the cracker even though you're serving salmon. No 5 year old wants raw salmon, unless you're a baby bear. Silly! I avoid her like the plague but overall great place. 1 star taken off for crazy, server lady!"
Beverly B.,"Boston, MA",2,12/21/18,Need to tell people as they come in alcohol needs to be purchased at registers with everything else. Went and shopped and came back to buy liquor only told then that I need to leave my cart at the beginning of the liquor store and get my alcohol purchased and then I can get my cart with my other purchases back. Please consider being more efficient and communicate this at the BEGINNING  of the shopping experience especially with your members!
Erin C.,"East Bridgewater, MA",2,11/8/18,"Placed on order online. Accepted a 5% surcharge because my membership had expired.  I had successfully done this in the past. Costco canceled the order. After many phone calls, Costco informed me that I wasn't allowed to place an order online unless I renewed my membership. We don't make it to to the warehouse enough to justify a $50 renewal fee and would have gladly paid the surcharge and kept spending hundreds at Costco online. It felt a little bit like they were strong-arming us into renewing. I told them I'd rather not, especially because BJs has waived membership fees starting on Nov 1.  BJs also offers online ordering. Happy to take our money elsewhere."
Melissa R.,"Canton, MA",1,9/11/17,"After waiting 15+ mins for someone to come out from the customer service desk to empty the full can/bottle machines even after they were told someone was waiting was the last straw for me. I'm done with them. It already boggled the mind that you need a chart to decipher what the aisle numbers represent, because they don't have clear signage with the general types of items on each aisle. This company doesn't have a customer-focused model. With a few changes they could be better...ensuring that can/bottle returns are emptied at the end of each day, putting in clear signage on the aisles, etc."
Opal D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,4/6/19,"Costco is great. It can get a little hectic here, especially when they're giving out food samples and people abandon their carts in the middle of  high traffic aisles just to go grab a sample ~ but otherwise they have good products at good prices."
Dan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,4/4/15,Slightly smaller costco with very few shoppers and usually a lot of free samples compared to west coast stores. Very friendly and helpful staff.Zero line at yhe pharmacy on a saturday
Juliana C.,"Toronto, Canada",5,10/12/16,"Flowers were low on my list of wedding priorities - I just couldn't justify spending a fortune on something that wouldn't last past the weekend. Fortunately, there was a Costco near our venue that offered tailored centerpieces - we're talking roses, daisies, leaves and baby's breath AND a trendy square vase - at $20 apiece.I'll admit I was a little skeptical about what quality I could expect for such a low price, but that skepticism allowed me to be bowled over by my order. In between picking up the centerpieces at Costco and shopping for additional wedding supplies, I was stopped by no less than five people asking what aisle I had gotten the flowers from, and how much they cost.The bouquets lasted overnight in the basement of our venue, throughout our 3 pm - midnight reception, and still looked perky the next day. I can't speak highly enough about the value and ease of ordering! For brides on a budget, Costco's flower selection is a godsend."
Marlena V.,"Providence, RI",3,7/19/15,"Since I don't live anywhere near the general vicinity of Costco, the supreme budget shopper in me was dying to try it out after an IKEA trip.  Since Costco is constantly raved and praised by lit. everyone I know (especially their locations in Japan) I was ready to check out the hype machine and take a look around.It was alright.I was disappointed right off the bat to find out that unlike other wholesale chains that they don't offer a trial membership.  Since we were traveling back and forth to IKEA for a big project I was ready to jump on the opportunity and make some purchases.  Alas, it was not to be.After looking at prices and the food varieties they offered, I really wasn't blown away.  Most, if not all of the prices I looked at in their meat department were comparable or in a couple cases, more, than what I normally pay at my local stores.  Granted I live out of state and for all I know, the prices may generally be more than where I live so in that regard, I give them the benefit of the doubt.The rest of their snacks, canned goods, pasta, etc were also generally the same deal as the meat.  I spied a very large box of morning blueberry biscuits the hubby loves for about $10: I had purchased the same bulk box in the same variety a couple weeks before at my local Job Lot for $4.99.  I honestly didn't find a single deal that blew me away.I will however, give them the 3 stars for their AMAZING snack bar.  $1.50 for a giant hot dog with all the fixins?  YES PLEASE.  Their ice cream sundaes are also equally amazing.Overall, I suppose I can see the appeal depending on local prices.  I for one, have always preferred to shop around to find discounts so someplace like Costco isn't really for me.I do give them huge props for treating their employees well!"
Alex C.,"Boston, MA",5,4/18/13,"Better living with CostcoFor all those who have never stepped foot inside a Costco because of a fear of bulk packaging  or concrete floors, let me share some secrets.  Costco does two things well that really set it apart from the other big box stores: quality product selection and margin cost pricing.  If margin cost pricing brings flashbacks of sweaty college final exams for you, relax: I was an economics major and can guide you through this one.  Costco adds a relatively low percentage over its costs when pricing the goods it sells.  That's it.  It does not try to get the highest dollar or ""market"" price, and the results are much lower overall prices.  And Costco applies this policy to name brand, quality products and you enjoy the benefits.  The result, for example, is that you can buy a fantastic bottle of 2010 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir for $23 that the wine shop down the street carries for $36.  Look at the jewelry case and find Michelle watches for hundreds of dollars less than elsewhere.   And that Pinot Noir and Michelle watches bring up the second point: Costco does a lot of the product selection for you before something hits the shelves, so you won't be confronted with dozens of different choices leaving you feeling slightly flummoxed about which product to buy, maybe a little unsure that you purchased the ""right"" one after you leave and certainly wasting your time in the process.  Instead, Costco puts excellent products on its shelves and in its refrigerated cases with somewhat limited choices, and when you put something in your cart there is a high degree of confidence that you will be happy with your purchase when you get home.  And if not, Costco will just as happily refund your money.  In years shopping there, I have never had a problem returning anything.   Among the things you may not have been expecting to find at Costco: roses, meats, fresh fish, cheese, fruits (huge pineapples for a couple of bucks), and rotisserie chickens (which are large and simply delicious).  There are also slowly rotating seasonal items, along with all the staples.  So, lots of toys around Christmas, replaced by furniture after the holidays, outdoor living gear in late spring, etc.  Every Costco is a little different, and the best way to see if you actually like your nearest one is to grab one of those oversized shopping carts and take the plunge.   You'll find me in front of the King Crab display with a couple bottles of a nice German Riesling in my cart."
Sandy D.,"Barnstable Town, MA",5,3/18/20,"I've been going to Costco for years. Never thought to review them. I don't know why because I LOVE this store!Their meat is ""bar none"" out of all the ""warehouse club"" stores! Seafood, believe it or not, is awesome! We buy Choice strip steaks and the price is usually $ 6.99/lb. and very, very good. They even have Prime cut steaks, but honestly the Choice steaks are awesome. They have Beef tenderloin cleaned or uncleaned. Trust me, buy it cleaned, it's worth the extra price per pound. We have bought Prime Rib on several occasions. They have the biggest scallops, that are super sweet. I bought haddock and was a little worried it wouldn't be so fresh. Wrong.....Super fresh. They have king crab legs, and every other seafood you can imagine.We have bought laminate flooring, a ""Snap On"" power washer, you name it. Their fresh produce is awesome. I have bought some of the best peaches I have ever eaten here.In case something isn't exactly to your liking, their return policy is very reasonable.  Great place to shop. They are a little distance from us, so we don't get there as much as we like. But that's OK...it's worth the trip."
Jacob C.,"Occoquan, VA",1,6/3/20,"This Costco warehouse is great, definitely deserving five stars. But the cellular phone service booth needs some improvement with its employees. I'll just cut to the chase - the part time guy named Dustin needs to be fired. Not only does he not have any motivation to help customers, but he is also way too incompetent in what he does. He is not fully aware of current promotions and he guesses and delivers wrong information to the customers. As a customer, I should not be telling the sales person what kind of promotions are being offered by specific carriers. And I should not be correcting him on the definition of opening a new line and upgrading from an existing account. Last but not least, I should not be begging a sales person for help to open a new account. I love the Costco cellular phone service and I will continue to use the booth for my cellphone needs, but you can be assured that Dustin will not earn my business or my respect. It clearly looked like to me that he didn't want to be there. He needs to be counseled and reprimanded."
Victoria N.,"Boston, MA",1,5/7/20,"Both times I've shopped at costco I've experienced unsatisfactory customer service.  The first time was when I was registering for my costco card. I waited in line over 20 minutes and then when it was finally time to go up and register for my member card,  at first I was told to come back the next day to register. Fortunately after arguing for some time I was helped to register. The 2nd time was last week. I waited in line due to covid 19 measures (which is fine). When I reached the front of the line the costco worker ( an older male) asked me if it was my first time  shopping there (it was not) and then asked me to show him my costco card (which I did). But I wondered why he had asked me this question when he did not ask the other 5 people in front of me. Did he recognize their faces but not mine, out of all the people that shop at costco? I highly doubt it."
Frank S.,"Lancaster, PA",1,7/24/20,I purchased my tires from Costco in PA. On the road to Maine.   I have a tire that won't hold air. They won't even look at it for 2 hours. Great service Costco.
Katy L.,"Dalton, MA",3,8/3/19,"This Cisco location had a real cold fish vibe, maybe the location? I can't say.... the staff wasn't very welcoming, the people shopping had a bit of an attitude about them very stuck up. Their noses were soooo high up in the air we couldn't figure out how they could possibly see where they were going. The store was well stocked with products just kind of unfriendly. We went to the food court for some ice cold frozen yogurt which is usually delicious but today was a bit of a let down. We also leftl not successfully locating the reason why we came to the store."
Phyllis A.,"Carmel, IN",5,12/7/19,Thank You to Pat at the Tire Center who made time even in the midst of being so busy to check the pressure and air in my tires today!! I know this is a service they typically offer but he even asked to check the spare which I let him even though they were extremely busy. Thankful that he did as that one was also low in air. Definitely feel safer on the road now. He was so pleasant too. Thank You Pat!
Robert C.,"Worcester, MA",4,9/3/19,"I love coming to this Costco, specifically because it's in New Hampshire meaning no sales tax! I can do huge purchases here and save a good amount. Not exactly the closest to where I live in MA but still conveniently located near the border!"
Carolyn H.,"Nashua, NH",5,5/17/19,"We love Costco, so much classier than the other 2 warehouses close by.Avoid the weekends as it is less crowded. There is a young woman at the pharmacy who often has some difficulty with thoroughness. We arrived home finding we had paid for 2 prescriptions but only had one in the bag! This happened May 17, 2019 between 3 - 4. We otherwise totally appreciated all the wonderful, caring employees"
chan n.,"Lowell, MA",5,6/4/17,Love Costco! Where I come from they have the gas station not this Costco doesn't have it. They have great deals and the food court is wonderful. Where else can u get pizza for so cheap and good? They are also very nice when you call ahead while shopping. The optometry department is also very nice.
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,8/4/18,"Some stuff is good but some are not cheap at all compared to other stores. Some staff are really nice and polite, but some are rude. It was so variable and it is hard to give either 1 or 5 stars."
Yi J.,"Nashua, NH",3,9/6/19,"Too crowded most of the time to have a relaxed, enjoyable shopping experience. Some staffs are very rude, no customer service skills."
Erik M.,"Lowell, MA",5,5/17/18,"Favorite place to buy clothes, bulk paper towels, toilet paper, etc for a house with a lot of people living in it. Their food court is great and I always get their pizza or Italian sausage. Also my go to place to buy soap, toothpaste and other essentials. It's well worth the 55-$60 spent a year because in the end I get the most value out of my dollar. Also got my newly released TCL 4k hdr TV from here for $450 on sale $100 bucks off for my ps4 pro and other future games that will have hdr features. Love that it's also in Nashua and it's close by to me and products are tax free."
K S.,"Huntington, MA",1,5/7/19,"Great Costco but it's the only one in New Hampshire!! And to top that off, it's right on the Massachusetts border to serve the flatlanders who just don't want to pay sales tax. Costco please wakyup and start serving New Hampshire residents by opening a store in central New Hampshire, please!"
Heather W.,"Waterbury, VT",5,5/20/18,"Excellent prices and wonderful customer service!  This is my new optician!After an extremely bad experience with a local optician, I booked an optical exam at the Nashua Costco out of desperation.  I had no more insurance and still needed new glasses. I ended up purchasing 4 great pairs of glasses for less than I paid for a single pair of glasses at the optician's office!  Service was excellent!  The doctor was able to diagnose and perscribe my perscription in one visit.  JP couldn't have been more helpful with picking out glasses and fitting them. Another thing that Costco will do for a small handling fee plus the cost of the lenses is update your existing frames.  At the optician, it was always cheaper to buy a whole new pair of glasses than to have old frames updated!"
Victoria W.,"Horseheads, NY",3,10/24/16,"It's a huge Costco, the biggest I can find within the 100 mi radius. No gas station here, but there is a cumberland gas right next door and the mall is right next door as well. ample parking. The lines here on the weekends are crazy, but I guess that's how it is. Fairly friendly cashiers at checkout and they make the lines run pretty smooth. The people who work at the food station are kind of grumpy. You basically get all your costco selections here. By no mean is this place the best costco ever, but it is one of the bigger stores in the area and it gets the job done. If you need to get gas at a warehouse club, the sams club in town has a gas station."
Fred L.,"Windham, NH",5,10/14/15,"The Costco in Nashua is a zoo on the weekends but the items that they carry are slightly different than those that are sold in the Danvers, Waltham or Everett stores. The core products are the same but all Costco locations do have a bit of differentiation to them. This location is excellent for the big ticket items as it doesn't have sales tax as you are in New Hampshire. I find the layout of all Costco stores in the Northeast to be very similar and this is not an exception to that rule. They have a very large electronics section and clothing section. I find that for the most part the clothes are well stacked and organized by size. Makes for much easier shopping when they take care of the merchandise as they do in this Costco.Like all Costco's the weekend is the time to show up for a bonanza of samples.Just a note that in March of 2016 the American Express card is NOT going to be accepted and I believe Visa is going to be the new card of choice for credit purchases."
Laura H.,"Westford, MA",1,1/11/17,"Don't go here if you're in need of getting new tires. It's been nearly two weeks and we've been lied too day after day about the arrival time of our tires. To find out, they never placed the damn order to begin with - so behold, we're stuck waiting another week riding around with a spare tire. It's just lie after lie, they'll say whatever to keep a hold of your money. This was the final straw, after calling yesterday and being told they'd DEFINITELY be in today and wait for it.....they're still not!!! We want to cancel the order but apparently we have to physically walk into the store to do so. You've got to be kidding, right? It's like they don't understand that we're driving with a spare tire and can't just hop in and drive long distances. We're bringing our business elsewhere. PS. Good luck trying to get a hold of them. You call their number and no answer after multiple tries, or someone will pick up and hang right up. Literally THE WORST."
Andrew C.,"Arlington, MA",3,11/27/12,"It's a Costco. Get some inexpensive food at the food counter.You will need a membership to enter. They have great deals!Pro tip #1: You don't need a membership to schedule an eye appointment.Pro tip #2: Purchase your food at the register and you can just pick up your food at the food court so you don't have to wait in line again.Pro tip#3: You can ask for their monthly coupons if you forgot yours. Bonus: You may bring your receipt back to get some money back, or just purchase the item again and return the full priced item."
Deirdre C.,"Danville, NH",5,9/15/14,"Not much else to report on this one since my review on the Waltham warehouse, other than this is our usual Costco.  Though my DH does go to the one near his office in Danvers, MA as well. Wasn't as busy for a Friday evening as usual. Made for a more pleasant shopping excursion.Picked up more organic eggs, didn't need TP (is that TMI?) or papertowels this time, though I forgot the Kirkland Signature boutique tissues (the upright box, not the long low box). But we did find a discount on KitchenAid countertop convection ovens. Wasn't something we were looking for, but since my big oven is gas, and propane is crazy expensive right now I tend to avoid using it much. But this countertop gizmo seemed a handy idea, since it's really only the two of us. Could probably even fit a small chicken in there on the lowest of three shelf positions. Oh, it deigns to do toast too. ;) Did a nice job on the croissants we got as well (those are so buttery and flaky... yummers!) yesterday morning.I was looking for a decorative red chest that I saw in the Waltham store. Nashua didn't have it, which was not totally unexpected. If you see it you have to grab things, but on that day there wouldn't have been room in the Jeep for both a big dog and a piece of furniture. Oh well...We even got another fall mum (aka hardy chrysanthemum, for those that gave me grief this week ;) ). They had a deal of 4-8"" plants for $12.99. We saw a couple of ladies who only had one mum in their buggy. They had misread the sign thinking they were $12.99 each. Made their day; then they made mine by saying they didn't really want four and was I interested in taking one off their hands. Absolutely! They didn't want to be reimbursed, but we wouldn't take it otherwise. They graciously gave up and let this pushy broad get her way. Thank you, ladies. :)"

I ended up purchasing 4 great pairs of glasses for less than I paid for a single pair of glasses at the optician's office!  Service was excellent!  The doctor was able to diagnose and perscribe my perscription in one visit.  JP couldn't have been more helpful with picking out glasses and fitting them. Another thing that Costco will do for a small handling fee plus the cost of the lenses is update your existing frames.  At the optician, it was always cheaper to buy a whole new pair of glasses than to have old frames updated!"
Victoria W.,"Horseheads, NY",3,10/24/16,"It's a huge Costco, the biggest I can find within the 100 mi radius. No gas station here, but there is a cumberland gas right next door and the mall is right next door as well. ample parking. The lines here on the weekends are crazy, but I guess that's how it is. Fairly friendly cashiers at checkout and they make the lines run pretty smooth. The people who work at the food station are kind of grumpy. You basically get all your costco selections here. By no mean is this place the best costco ever, but it is one of the bigger stores in the area and it gets the job done. If you need to get gas at a warehouse club, the sams club in town has a gas station."
Fred L.,"Windham, NH",5,10/14/15,"The Costco in Nashua is a zoo on the weekends but the items that they carry are slightly different than those that are sold in the Danvers, Waltham or Everett stores. The core products are the same but all Costco locations do have a bit of differentiation to them. This location is excellent for the big ticket items as it doesn't have sales tax as you are in New Hampshire. I find the layout of all Costco stores in the Northeast to be very similar and this is not an exception to that rule. They have a very large electronics section and clothing section. I find that for the most part the clothes are well stacked and organized by size. Makes for much easier shopping when they take care of the merchandise as they do in this Costco.Like all Costco's the weekend is the time to show up for a bonanza of samples.Just a note that in March of 2016 the American Express card is NOT going to be accepted and I believe Visa is going to be the new card of choice for credit purchases."
Laura H.,"Westford, MA",1,1/11/17,"Don't go here if you're in need of getting new tires. It's been nearly two weeks and we've been lied too day after day about the arrival time of our tires. To find out, they never placed the damn order to begin with - so behold, we're stuck waiting another week riding around with a spare tire. It's just lie after lie, they'll say whatever to keep a hold of your money. This was the final straw, after calling yesterday and being told they'd DEFINITELY be in today and wait for it.....they're still not!!! We want to cancel the order but apparently we have to physically walk into the store to do so. You've got to be kidding, right? It's like they don't understand that we're driving with a spare tire and can't just hop in and drive long distances. We're bringing our business elsewhere. PS. Good luck trying to get a hold of them. You call their number and no answer after multiple tries, or someone will pick up and hang right up. Literally THE WORST."
Andrew C.,"Arlington, MA",3,11/27/12,"It's a Costco. Get some inexpensive food at the food counter.You will need a membership to enter. They have great deals!Pro tip #1: You don't need a membership to schedule an eye appointment.Pro tip #2: Purchase your food at the register and you can just pick up your food at the food court so you don't have to wait in line again.Pro tip#3: You can ask for their monthly coupons if you forgot yours. Bonus: You may bring your receipt back to get some money back, or just purchase the item again and return the full priced item."
Deirdre C.,"Danville, NH",5,9/15/14,"Not much else to report on this one since my review on the Waltham warehouse, other than this is our usual Costco.  Though my DH does go to the one near his office in Danvers, MA as well. Wasn't as busy for a Friday evening as usual. Made for a more pleasant shopping excursion.Picked up more organic eggs, didn't need TP (is that TMI?) or papertowels this time, though I forgot the Kirkland Signature boutique tissues (the upright box, not the long low box). But we did find a discount on KitchenAid countertop convection ovens. Wasn't something we were looking for, but since my big oven is gas, and propane is crazy expensive right now I tend to avoid using it much. But this countertop gizmo seemed a handy idea, since it's really only the two of us. Could probably even fit a small chicken in there on the lowest of three shelf positions. Oh, it deigns to do toast too. ;) Did a nice job on the croissants we got as well (those are so buttery and flaky... yummers!) yesterday morning.I was looking for a decorative red chest that I saw in the Waltham store. Nashua didn't have it, which was not totally unexpected. If you see it you have to grab things, but on that day there wouldn't have been room in the Jeep for both a big dog and a piece of furniture. Oh well...We even got another fall mum (aka hardy chrysanthemum, for those that gave me grief this week ;) ). They had a deal of 4-8"" plants for $12.99. We saw a couple of ladies who only had one mum in their buggy. They had misread the sign thinking they were $12.99 each. Made their day; then they made mine by saying they didn't really want four and was I interested in taking one off their hands. Absolutely! They didn't want to be reimbursed, but we wouldn't take it otherwise. They graciously gave up and let this pushy broad get her way. Thank you, ladies. :)"
Ananya G.,"Lowell, MA",4,3/24/18,"Apart from my love for Costco in general, I love their churros and combo pizza. It's cheap and tasty."
Sandy D.,"Barnstable Town, MA",5,3/18/20,"I've been going to Costco for years. Never thought to review them. I don't know why because I LOVE this store!Their meat is ""bar none"" out of all the ""warehouse club"" stores! Seafood, believe it or not, is awesome! We buy Choice strip steaks and the price is usually $ 6.99/lb. and very, very good. They even have Prime cut steaks, but honestly the Choice steaks are awesome. They have Beef tenderloin cleaned or uncleaned. Trust me, buy it cleaned, it's worth the extra price per pound. We have bought Prime Rib on several occasions. They have the biggest scallops, that are super sweet. I bought haddock and was a little worried it wouldn't be so fresh. Wrong.....Super fresh. They have king crab legs, and every other seafood you can imagine.We have bought laminate flooring, a ""Snap On"" power washer, you name it. Their fresh produce is awesome. I have bought some of the best peaches I have ever eaten here.In case something isn't exactly to your liking, their return policy is very reasonable.  Great place to shop. They are a little distance from us, so we don't get there as much as we like. But that's OK...it's worth the trip."
Jacob C.,"Occoquan, VA",1,6/3/20,"This Costco warehouse is great, definitely deserving five stars. But the cellular phone service booth needs some improvement with its employees. I'll just cut to the chase - the part time guy named Dustin needs to be fired. Not only does he not have any motivation to help customers, but he is also way too incompetent in what he does. He is not fully aware of current promotions and he guesses and delivers wrong information to the customers. As a customer, I should not be telling the sales person what kind of promotions are being offered by specific carriers. And I should not be correcting him on the definition of opening a new line and upgrading from an existing account. Last but not least, I should not be begging a sales person for help to open a new account. I love the Costco cellular phone service and I will continue to use the booth for my cellphone needs, but you can be assured that Dustin will not earn my business or my respect. It clearly looked like to me that he didn't want to be there. He needs to be counseled and reprimanded."
Victoria N.,"Boston, MA",1,5/7/20,"Both times I've shopped at costco I've experienced unsatisfactory customer service.  The first time was when I was registering for my costco card. I waited in line over 20 minutes and then when it was finally time to go up and register for my member card,  at first I was told to come back the next day to register. Fortunately after arguing for some time I was helped to register. The 2nd time was last week. I waited in line due to covid 19 measures (which is fine). When I reached the front of the line the costco worker ( an older male) asked me if it was my first time  shopping there (it was not) and then asked me to show him my costco card (which I did). But I wondered why he had asked me this question when he did not ask the other 5 people in front of me. Did he recognize their faces but not mine, out of all the people that shop at costco? I highly doubt it."
Frank S.,"Lancaster, PA",1,7/24/20,I purchased my tires from Costco in PA. On the road to Maine.   I have a tire that won't hold air. They won't even look at it for 2 hours. Great service Costco.
Katy L.,"Dalton, MA",3,8/3/19,"This Cisco location had a real cold fish vibe, maybe the location? I can't say.... the staff wasn't very welcoming, the people shopping had a bit of an attitude about them very stuck up. Their noses were soooo high up in the air we couldn't figure out how they could possibly see where they were going. The store was well stocked with products just kind of unfriendly. We went to the food court for some ice cold frozen yogurt which is usually delicious but today was a bit of a let down. We also leftl not successfully locating the reason why we came to the store."
Phyllis A.,"Carmel, IN",5,12/7/19,Thank You to Pat at the Tire Center who made time even in the midst of being so busy to check the pressure and air in my tires today!! I know this is a service they typically offer but he even asked to check the spare which I let him even though they were extremely busy. Thankful that he did as that one was also low in air. Definitely feel safer on the road now. He was so pleasant too. Thank You Pat!
Robert C.,"Worcester, MA",4,9/3/19,"I love coming to this Costco, specifically because it's in New Hampshire meaning no sales tax! I can do huge purchases here and save a good amount. Not exactly the closest to where I live in MA but still conveniently located near the border!"
Carolyn H.,"Nashua, NH",5,5/17/19,"We love Costco, so much classier than the other 2 warehouses close by.Avoid the weekends as it is less crowded. There is a young woman at the pharmacy who often has some difficulty with thoroughness. We arrived home finding we had paid for 2 prescriptions but only had one in the bag! This happened May 17, 2019 between 3 - 4. We otherwise totally appreciated all the wonderful, caring employees"
chan n.,"Lowell, MA",5,6/4/17,Love Costco! Where I come from they have the gas station not this Costco doesn't have it. They have great deals and the food court is wonderful. Where else can u get pizza for so cheap and good? They are also very nice when you call ahead while shopping. The optometry department is also very nice.
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,8/4/18,"Some stuff is good but some are not cheap at all compared to other stores. Some staff are really nice and polite, but some are rude. It was so variable and it is hard to give either 1 or 5 stars."
Yi J.,"Nashua, NH",3,9/6/19,"Too crowded most of the time to have a relaxed, enjoyable shopping experience. Some staffs are very rude, no customer service skills."
Erik M.,"Lowell, MA",5,5/17/18,"Favorite place to buy clothes, bulk paper towels, toilet paper, etc for a house with a lot of people living in it. Their food court is great and I always get their pizza or Italian sausage. Also my go to place to buy soap, toothpaste and other essentials. It's well worth the 55-$60 spent a year because in the end I get the most value out of my dollar. Also got my newly released TCL 4k hdr TV from here for $450 on sale $100 bucks off for my ps4 pro and other future games that will have hdr features. Love that it's also in Nashua and it's close by to me and products are tax free."
K S.,"Huntington, MA",1,5/7/19,"Great Costco but it's the only one in New Hampshire!!

They really have a good system going with managing lines and keeping us at a safe distance from each other due to the Corona Virus. Keep up the good work to all the workers there. We were in and out in minutes!!! Well done!!! stars
A L.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/22/16,"Nothing bad to say about this place. I've probably visited this place close to 200 times in my lifetime as my father is their best customer and he would get the ""KIRKLAND SIGNATURE"" (store brand) tattooed on himself if he could (who knows, maybe as he gets older and more senile, he might actually do this! haha).Everything at Costco is great, but here are some of my highlights:Meats: Quite the selection of meats, and the butchers will even go out of their way to cut you something to your liking if you can't find it in the meat case. The price is right, and the cuts of meat are very fresh.Liquor/Wine: Outstanding service and great selection. The best prices around... I go out of my way to stock up on Oyster Bay sauvignon blanc here- you can't get it anywhere cheaper!Clothing: Believe it or not, the clothes are not bad. They cycle through inventory pretty regularly and have pretty good quality of clothes for reasonable prices. I've bought everything from pajamas to underwear, jeans (for my dad), socks, and some of their winter and fall coats are better prices than you can find anywhere (If you're not a snob about wearing a name brand!)Return Policy: One of the best return policies you can find anywhere. They will take anything. From tomatoes that just aren't fresh enough, to clothing that has been worn and not been satisfactory. I never make purchases here worried about ""what-if's"" as I do in many other stores. Sometimes the check-out is a little slow due to congestion, and its pretty impossible to get a parking spot close to the store... my only 2 semi-complaints.Get a Costco AMEX or be prepared to pay with a debit card.This place is so much better than BJ's."
Emily K.,"Revere, MA",1,10/8/20,"Okay, this review is actually for the Auto tire shop there and it was a year or two ago. If I were you, I would NOT get my tires replaced here. After I got my front tires replaced they very clearly put it on wrong or something because every week I had to go back because I had a flat tire. It was my front drivers side tire. I was only 17 having to go there legit every week. I would get stranded places randomly because I would go outside and my tire was just too flat to drive on and I'd have to call people to come fill it up to get it to Costco so they can say they are fixing a leak in my tire and then a week, sometimes a couple days later I would be right back there. Just don't do it I am so unbelievably frustrated still to this day. That front tire is always flat. I am not exaggerating at all, I basically spent my senior year of high school at costco."
David D.,"Beverly, MA",1,9/12/20,"Very screwed up system for buying tires. I ordered online and went to get them installed. Tech said they were not the right tires for the car and I should call to have my money refunded. I tried several times to reach them by phone and no answer or wait for over an hour. No refund, no tires 800 number is a joke, customer service person in the store said they would not help because we were already talking to the 800 number. We have been a long time member of BJs and have typically had good experiences. I am dropping my membership and canceling my credit card. Good luck getting me back."
SmartGal B.,"Billerica, MA",1,3/21/20,"Visited on 03/20/20 yes, I understand we are in a pandemic-however-I am a caregiver for disabled elderly who cannot get out.Went to 6 different stores for toilet paper finally got a friend who has a card to take me as a guest.Felt like I was in a communist society-this was one of the most horrific experiences ever. Take a look at the lines. Once inside-it was a shopping cart race to toilet paper! Never being in the store before (and never planning to go again!) I followed the crowd.Upon checking out-I was denied the purchase by staffers who claimed its ""1 per card holding person"" of course staff offered to sign me up for a card at the cost of $60-ISNT THAT PRICE GAUGING????Staff did not care-even though I was with a physical disabled person who had to wait in the same line.Its business' like this who need to be yelped- this is illegal and there should be no rule bending or allowance because of the pandemic.Do not go unless you wish to be treated unfairly, I certainly will recommend anywhere BUT COSTCO."
John H.,"Wilmington, MA",1,4/5/20,"They are only allowing people in groups of two. My group was three, my wife, daughter, and I. When I asked why the reason given was that ""when two people come out, we can only allow two in"" They were serious. When I asked why couldn't we wait for three people to leave, the person could bot answer m s. I was just asking for elementary level math to be used, but apparently that was too difficult. I get the limit of peope, but do not understand why two people with a child was a big deal."
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",2,9/3/19,They discontinued their All American Chocolate Cake.  Are you kidding me?  That was the best thing they made!  I'm guessing that the profit margin wasn't high enough and they were afraid it wouldn't sell at a higher price.  Surely it's not because it wasn't selling well.  So disappointed!
Leslie N.,"MA, MA",2,5/2/18,"I'm honestly not sure how there are such good reviews on this location. I'm from Texas and we have Costco there and it doesn't even compare to this location. Based on the numerous times I've visited, this location doesn't replenish their produce nearly enough, and multiple times I've had rotten pineapples, packaged lettuce that was brown, etc.  The refrigerated produce section is absolutely tiny and rarely has organic produce.People here don't smile and they seem like they truly dislike their jobs, and I don't feel at all appreciated for my business. Every time I come here I tell myself I'm going to stop. If it wasn't for the select few favorite items that I can only find here (Almond Butter, frozen organic foods, etc) I would cancel my membership.Don't even get me started on the gasoline area. There is an attendant there that scolded me for getting back into my car while pumping gas because I didn't want to breathe in the fumes. He told me it's ""against the rules"" to sit in your car because of the static electricity, which might be a recommendation, but should not be a ""rule."" So ridiculous."
Angela S.,"Saugus, MA",5,6/9/19,"Did you ever have that moment when you knew a you were about to endure a whole lot of aggravation  which was gonna take escalation after escalation to resolve it and it gives you anxiety to even think about it. Well that's the kind of situation I was preparing myself for when I walked into Costco today because it was EXACTLY the treatment I received before it was escalated to Mikki.  A kind hearted, sweetheart who's only goal was to resolve my issue and she did just that treating me exactly the way I should be treated. I have dealt with Costco supervisors before regarding something different and they are just rude, arrogant, dismissive and unprofessional. So when you hire someone who knows how to treat the public the way they should be treated then I feel I should take the time to reciprocate. Hopefully Costco will consider hiring more people like Mikki so customers feel comfortable with any and all dealings..... Thank you   Mikki"
Aaron L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2/11/19,"I have been a member of Costco for more than 20 years.  All the time I l think that Costco will provide good customer service.  But my impression about Costco customer service has changed recently.I went to shop in the Mountain View, CA warehouse on 2/9/2109.  Then as usual, I paid the merchandises at the register.  After having scanned the merchandises, I paid the merchandises.  The Cashier then gave me a receipt.I pushed my shopping cart to exit where an Associate checked my receipt and the merchandises in the shopping cart.  The Associate then said that there was an item in the cart which I had not paid.  I explained to him that it was not my fault, and asked him which item had not been paid.  I told him that I was in a hurry and that he could take away the so called ""unpaid"" item.  However, he said that he did not know which item had not been paid and told me to push my shopping cart to another customer representative who would sort it out for me.There were many customers around me, and they looked at me whilst I was talking to the associate.  I felt very embarrassing. I felt that Costco was treating me as a thief stealing merchandises from Costco.  It is the duty and responsibility of the Cashier to scan the merchandises thoroughly.  As a customer, I trust the Cashier doing their job properly, and pay the merchandises according to what they say during check out. On this occasion, the Cashier omitted to ring an item during check out, resulting me being treated as a thief to steal something from Costco.The management of Costco should direct their staffs to be more careful to avoid causing embarrassment to customers.  Do not let we customers to pay for the mistakes made by their staffs."
Tom K.,"Beverly, MA",5,2/17/19,Been a Costco member since 1999 love the company and the service they provide to there customers. This location is a bit smaller than some on the west coast but great nonetheless. And gas prices are unbeatable especially for 93 octane.
Fred L.,"Windham, NH",5,7/2/14,"A good company starts with a good staff and this place should be the model for all other companies/stores. From the greater at the door to the employees straightening up the clothes, the people giving out samples to the cashiers I find all who work here to be a pleasure to deal with. Costco sells their own brand of goods under the name Kirkland and thousands of items under the known brand names,  Heinz, Charmin, Bounty, HP, Sony, etc. It is tough with electronics to get reviews because many of their items are given specific model numbers just for them. However,  their return policy is very liberal on all items. Aside from electronics which have a 90 day warranty all other items can be returned at any time for whatever reason. It is sad but I have seen the most pathetic of returns and the employees don't take it personally or give the ""member"" an issue but take the item back. The food court is very good and while pizzas can be ordered and ready within 10 minutes for carryout. They have expanded their menu to have several different selections but the best deal is still the hot dog and soda with free refills for under a $1.60.The optical department has the absolute lowest prices around and honestly is worth joining just to get glasses if you need them. My mother were progressive lenses that she was quoted over $600 at her local eye care shop and Costco was under $150 for the same caliber materials including polarization, Crizal and whatever else sunglasses come with. They also have name brand frames in the store as well. Bill,  the assistant store manager is a great guy,  always looking to help out his team members and customers. Dianne,  in the optical department is a great lady with a great sense of style in optical. The pharmacy also can in many cases save you tons of money,  you just have to price out the RX, from a major pharmacy,  mail order and Costco to see which is the best route for you. I have never dealt with the tire center but I would assume that the pricing is competitive but I am not sure of the selection that is available. Costco only takes American Express as a credit card. They take debit,  cash and checks as well."
Marissa G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,1/7/19,"If you you get hungry while shopping, you have to try their fresh açaí bowls at checkout! They come loaded with fresh fruit and granola for under $5!Also, very friendly and helpful staff."
Michael C.,"Hampton, NH",4,10/1/18,"Warehouse located in Danvers, MA.Very busy even on the weekdays.Best times to shop is still during the week.Gas station near entrance driveway is always busy with long lines!"
Larry B.,"Rockport, MA",5,6/24/18,"I could nit pick that they don't have everything a supermarket carries but that isn't what they are.  They ARE all about having high quality food at reasonable if not ridiculously cheap prices.  Their rotisserie chickens are FABULOUS.  Downright delicious and much bigger than what you get at any supermarket.  Taste much better as well and incredibly FRESH.  You can get them right out of the oven.In addition, they have a bunch of items that have immediate ""rebates""  Today I bought a McCormick 19oz Bourbon Brown Sugar Seasoning.  Never tried it but for $3 and change, you can't pass it up.  The cashiers are friendly and fast.  Forgot to mention you get a rebate at the end of the year so it saves you even more."
Bob B.,"Woburn, MA",4,5/19/18,"I love shopping here can never get away without spending $200! Wish they had hot coffee, instead of bottled water and sugary soft drinks!"

Don't be too picky cause then you're just annoying, but if you're willing to save a bunch of money then this is the place for you. Tons of samples and tons of brand name products. You want a TV they got it. You want steak they got it. You want a Christmas things they got it. Also gas is cheap as hell why would you go anywhere else. Don't be snobby everyone is just tryna get some cha Ching so they can buy more stuff with that extra cha Ching. Also they have good food so if you're like me and you break a solid sweat shopping for random things then BOOM cheap good, fill ya up food. BOOM money saved."
Meghan C.,"Wakefield, MA",1,3/4/18,"Unfortunately, the customer service here is truly lacking. My sister and I have a family membership, which means we are both in the account. I asked the cashier  for 2 separate transactions to which I was scolded about how ""bringing all of your friends in here doesn't benefit our members or keep our costs down."" She then handed me information about becoming a member. Once she was finished, I made her aware I already am a member and my sister who made the first transaction and I are in the same account which she is welcome to look up! Her response ""oh"".  It was disappointing to have such an unwelcoming, and unpleasant experience as my family have been members of Costco for years and years. I am starting to wonder if I will have a more pleasant experience at BJ's? As the consumer, she did not even ask why we wanted separate transactions and immediately was unkind and rude in her tone. Very disappointed in my shopping experience at this location!"
Samia K.,"Chicago, IL",1,12/21/17,"I am a loyal Costco customer and I have been to several locations throughout the country. However, this is by far the worst location mainly due to bad customer service. My first bad experience was about a year ago when I wanted to return an item. At other locations, they are able to use your Costco card to return items without receipts, however here they refused to return my item without the original receipt. Makes no sense. My brother and I share the Costco account and have our own cards. At another occasion, I took his card since I misplaced mine. I reached checkout with my nephew who was throwing a tantram and the lady at the register said I cant purchase without my own Costco card. Yes, I was having a bad day, I should have had my card but I didn't. I told her that I, unfortunately, do not have my own card but she can check my name on the account, I am the primary account holder. Anyhow, the manager came by and checked my name on the account and allowed her to let me use my brother's card. I reminded the lady at the register THREE times, please these are 2 separate transactions do not charge them on the same credit card. Of course she purposely put everything on the same credit card, and then very rudely told me to go to customer service so that they can do a refund and do the whole transaction AGAIN! This is with a 2 year old toddler crying at the top of his lungs. Shame on her. I understand that Costco locations have strict rules for card holders, but really after several years of loyalty and thousands of $$ spent, they should assess the situation and cut some slack for people dealing with kids. Never going back at this location again."
Ari H.,"Newton, MA",4,4/23/13,"My latest purchase:- 16 ounces of smoked salmon for $14- 22 ounces of pesto for $8- 52 disposable razors for $25- 12 pairs of socks for $20Compare food costs at supermarkets, this is a great deal.

Gina M.,"Middleton, MA",5,3/17/20,Was just here shopping with my mom.

A L.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/22/16,"Nothing bad to say about this place. I've probably visited this place close to 200 times in my lifetime as my father is their best customer and he would get the ""KIRKLAND SIGNATURE"" (store brand) tattooed on himself if he could (who knows, maybe as he gets older and more senile, he might actually do this! haha).Everything at Costco is great, but here are some of my highlights:Meats: Quite the selection of meats, and the butchers will even go out of their way to cut you something to your liking if you can't find it in the meat case. The price is right, and the cuts of meat are very fresh.Liquor/Wine: Outstanding service and great selection. The best prices around... I go out of my way to stock up on Oyster Bay sauvignon blanc here- you can't get it anywhere cheaper!Clothing: Believe it or not, the clothes are not bad. They cycle through inventory pretty regularly and have pretty good quality of clothes for reasonable prices. I've bought everything from pajamas to underwear, jeans (for my dad), socks, and some of their winter and fall coats are better prices than you can find anywhere (If you're not a snob about wearing a name brand!)Return Policy: One of the best return policies you can find anywhere. They will take anything. From tomatoes that just aren't fresh enough, to clothing that has been worn and not been satisfactory. I never make purchases here worried about ""what-if's"" as I do in many other stores. Sometimes the check-out is a little slow due to congestion, and its pretty impossible to get a parking spot close to the store... my only 2 semi-complaints.Get a Costco AMEX or be prepared to pay with a debit card.This place is so much better than BJ's."
Emily K.,"Revere, MA",1,10/8/20,"Okay, this review is actually for the Auto tire shop there and it was a year or two ago. If I were you, I would NOT get my tires replaced here. After I got my front tires replaced they very clearly put it on wrong or something because every week I had to go back because I had a flat tire. It was my front drivers side tire. I was only 17 having to go there legit every week. I would get stranded places randomly because I would go outside and my tire was just too flat to drive on and I'd have to call people to come fill it up to get it to Costco so they can say they are fixing a leak in my tire and then a week, sometimes a couple days later I would be right back there. Just don't do it I am so unbelievably frustrated still to this day. That front tire is always flat. I am not exaggerating at all, I basically spent my senior year of high school at costco."
David D.,"Beverly, MA",1,9/12/20,"Very screwed up system for buying tires. I ordered online and went to get them installed. Tech said they were not the right tires for the car and I should call to have my money refunded. I tried several times to reach them by phone and no answer or wait for over an hour. No refund, no tires 800 number is a joke, customer service person in the store said they would not help because we were already talking to the 800 number. We have been a long time member of BJs and have typically had good experiences. I am dropping my membership and canceling my credit card. Good luck getting me back."

John H.,"Wilmington, MA",1,4/5/20,"They are only allowing people in groups of two. My group was three, my wife, daughter, and I.

Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",2,9/3/19,They discontinued their All American Chocolate Cake.  Are you kidding me?  That was the best thing they made!  I'm guessing that the profit margin wasn't high enough and they were afraid it wouldn't sell at a higher price.  Surely it's not because it wasn't selling well.  So disappointed!
Leslie N.,"MA, MA",2,5/2/18,"I'm honestly not sure how there are such good reviews on this location. I'm from Texas and we have Costco there and it doesn't even compare to this location. Based on the numerous times I've visited, this location doesn't replenish their produce nearly enough, and multiple times I've had rotten pineapples, packaged lettuce that was brown, etc.  The refrigerated produce section is absolutely tiny and rarely has organic produce.People here don't smile and they seem like they truly dislike their jobs, and I don't feel at all appreciated for my business. Every time I come here I tell myself I'm going to stop. If it wasn't for the select few favorite items that I can only find here (Almond Butter, frozen organic foods, etc) I would cancel my membership.Don't even get me started on the gasoline area. There is an attendant there that scolded me for getting back into my car while pumping gas because I didn't want to breathe in the fumes.

I have dealt with Costco supervisors before regarding something different and they are just rude, arrogant, dismissive and unprofessional.

Tom K.,"Beverly, MA",5,2/17/19,Been a Costco member since 1999 love the company and the service they provide to there customers. This location is a bit smaller than some on the west coast but great nonetheless. And gas prices are unbeatable especially for 93 octane.
Fred L.,"Windham, NH",5,7/2/14,"A good company starts with a good staff and this place should be the model for all other companies/stores. From the greater at the door to the employees straightening up the clothes, the people giving out samples to the cashiers I find all who work here to be a pleasure to deal with. Costco sells their own brand of goods under the name Kirkland and thousands of items under the known brand names,  Heinz, Charmin, Bounty, HP, Sony, etc. It is tough with electronics to get reviews because many of their items are given specific model numbers just for them. However,  their return policy is very liberal on all items. Aside from electronics which have a 90 day warranty all other items can be returned at any time for whatever reason. It is sad but I have seen the most pathetic of returns and the employees don't take it personally or give the ""member"" an issue but take the item back. The food court is very good and while pizzas can be ordered and ready within 10 minutes for carryout. They have expanded their menu to have several different selections but the best deal is still the hot dog and soda with free refills for under a $1.60.The optical department has the absolute lowest prices around and honestly is worth joining just to get glasses if you need them. My mother were progressive lenses that she was quoted over $600 at her local eye care shop and Costco was under $150 for the same caliber materials including polarization, Crizal and whatever else sunglasses come with. They also have name brand frames in the store as well. Bill,  the assistant store manager is a great guy,  always looking to help out his team members and customers. Dianne,  in the optical department is a great lady with a great sense of style in optical. The pharmacy also can in many cases save you tons of money,  you just have to price out the RX, from a major pharmacy,  mail order and Costco to see which is the best route for you.

Larry B.,"Rockport, MA",5,6/24/18,"I could nit pick that they don't have everything a supermarket carries but that isn't what they are.  They ARE all about having high quality food at reasonable if not ridiculously cheap prices.  Their rotisserie chickens are FABULOUS.  Downright delicious and much bigger than what you get at any supermarket.  Taste much better as well and incredibly FRESH.  You can get them right out of the oven.In addition, they have a bunch of items that have immediate ""rebates""  Today I bought a McCormick 19oz Bourbon Brown Sugar Seasoning.  Never tried it but for $3 and change, you can't pass it up.  The cashiers are friendly and fast.  Forgot to mention you get a rebate at the end of the year so it saves you even more."
Bob B.,"Woburn, MA",4,5/19/18,"I love shopping here can never get away without spending $200! Wish they had hot coffee, instead of bottled water and sugary soft drinks!"
John V.,"North Andover, MA",5,1/11/19,"This place is amazing. Anything you want or need they got. Just show up buy some stuff and boom you're all set for the month. Don't be too picky cause then you're just annoying, but if you're willing to save a bunch of money then this is the place for you. Tons of samples and tons of brand name products. You want a TV they got it. You want steak they got it. You want a Christmas things they got it. Also gas is cheap as hell why would you go anywhere else. Don't be snobby everyone is just tryna get some cha Ching so they can buy more stuff with that extra cha Ching. Also they have good food so if you're like me and you break a solid sweat shopping for random things then BOOM cheap good, fill ya up food. BOOM money saved."
Meghan C.,"Wakefield, MA",1,3/4/18,"Unfortunately, the customer service here is truly lacking. My sister and I have a family membership, which means we are both in the account. I asked the cashier  for 2 separate transactions to which I was scolded about how ""bringing all of your friends in here doesn't benefit our members or keep our costs down."" She then handed me information about becoming a member. Once she was finished, I made her aware I already am a member and my sister who made the first transaction and I are in the same account which she is welcome to look up! Her response ""oh"".  It was disappointing to have such an unwelcoming, and unpleasant experience as my family have been members of Costco for years and years. I am starting to wonder if I will have a more pleasant experience at BJ's? As the consumer, she did not even ask why we wanted separate transactions and immediately was unkind and rude in her tone. Very disappointed in my shopping experience at this location!"
Samia K.,"Chicago, IL",1,12/21/17,"I am a loyal Costco customer and I have been to several locations throughout the country. However, this is by far the worst location mainly due to bad customer service. My first bad experience was about a year ago when I wanted to return an item. At other locations, they are able to use your Costco card to return items without receipts, however here they refused to return my item without the original receipt. Makes no sense. My brother and I share the Costco account and have our own cards. At another occasion, I took his card since I misplaced mine. I reached checkout with my nephew who was throwing a tantram and the lady at the register said I cant purchase without my own Costco card. Yes, I was having a bad day, I should have had my card but I didn't. I told her that I, unfortunately, do not have my own card but she can check my name on the account, I am the primary account holder. Anyhow, the manager came by and checked my name on the account and allowed her to let me use my brother's card. I reminded the lady at the register THREE times, please these are 2 separate transactions do not charge them on the same credit card. Of course she purposely put everything on the same credit card, and then very rudely told me to go to customer service so that they can do a refund and do the whole transaction AGAIN! This is with a 2 year old toddler crying at the top of his lungs. Shame on her. I understand that Costco locations have strict rules for card holders, but really after several years of loyalty and thousands of $$ spent, they should assess the situation and cut some slack for people dealing with kids. Never going back at this location again."
Ari H.,"Newton, MA",4,4/23/13,"My latest purchase:- 16 ounces of smoked salmon for $14- 22 ounces of pesto for $8- 52 disposable razors for $25- 12 pairs of socks for $20Compare food costs at supermarkets, this is a great deal. Ditto for the razors. The socks could have been cheaper in TJ Maxx, but hey.I then bought gas at $3.26 a gallon.Any questions?"
Anne D.,"Lee, MA",5,7/18/20,My husband and I stopped in at Costco early one Saturday morning. We were pleased and surprised that the 1st hour was dedicated to seniors. What a pleasure shopping in a quiet store. The checkout area was spotless as were the bathrooms. What a nice experience!  Great job!!
Marie C.,"Chicopee, MA",1,6/4/20,Sad that they don't realize that they have a blatant racist working for a company that serves the general public. Will be telling people not to shop there. Embarrassing.
Lisa M.,"Hampden, MA",5,7/17/20,"You always have great prices on clothes deli, bakery, oh and on my glasses. You are wonderful."
Shayla M.,"Springfield, MA",5,9/6/19,"Like all other Costcos-they have everything you needs and didnt know you needed at low prices and bulk amounts! A true value for families. The staff is friendly, options are plentiful, samples galore, and building is clean!  I really enjoy their produce section, as well as their cleaning products and bottled water deals! Me and my husband have also used the optic center inside which we found to be tiny but friendly and accommodating. A pleasent exsperience. On the way out we love to enjoy a dirty cheap meal of long hotdogs and fountains drinks! They do need to restoke the condient section much, MUCH more frequently. I learned early on to enjoy a plain hotdog because the condiment section is usually slim pickings.  Overall the store is what you would exspect."

Eric W.,"Westfield, MA",5,6/12/19,I'm going to give these boys a five star as it's pretty well squared away. It's always packed no matter what day you come and the parking can be a pain in the butt but that's not really their fault as they have a giant lot. Even their little snack bar is go although sometimes the tables aren't clean well enough again with the amount of people it's gotta be a difficult task to stay on top of. Navigating through the aisles when it's busy can be a bear as most folk take up the entire aisle and don't seem to care.

SeongYoon C.,"Hartford, CT",5,6/8/18,I think we all know Costco has a great business model. They treat their customers and employees well. We've been coming to this location for a few years and I'm finally leaving a review because.... they now also carry AÇAÍ BOWLS in the food court.The tire center guys are also great. I had a flat once and the guy was nice enough to come out and take a look and help me. They also have a wide range of food items including korean food products which is extremely convenient for me and my family. I know there is a Costco location in new Britain as well but that one doesn't have a photo center. I think the enfield location is a little better as they have all the Costco services. Now I just need them to do oil changes here (wishful thinking).
Gemma D.,"Rehoboth, MA",5,1/12/19,"Just wanted to shout out Jay, the checkout girl today 12-Jan-2019 around 12:30 who was super nice and chill and I didn't know you needed the card before starting the checkout process and my friend was grabbing one last thing and Jay was like ""don't worry about it, it's all good,"" which was the best because Costco at noon on a Saturday is a stressful / busy place but she was super nice and deserves a shout out! :)Also, we couldn't find pesto and some other lady went and found it for us and she was super nice, but I didn't see her name tag, but shout out to the pesto-getter too!"

Felicia N.,"West Springfield, MA",1,6/23/19,I'm so ripped. Spend 2 hours in the store. A grocery bill easily $300. Wait in line.

Because our 90 yr old grandmother couldn't come out in this heat today. What the hell is wrong with this place. The membership is that important to them that we can't shop for our grandmother. Unbelievable. Best believe. Never will come back. We come here pretty often an never a problem. Except today. Unreal.

Wayne K.,"Coram, NY",1,3/22/18,"This review concerns the TIRE CENTER. We needed tires for our Jetta, amongst other things.

The did not have 2 matching tires in stock I could use, and my size is still a common size. Now, I just retired from working for one of their tire suppliers back on Long Island, and have over 37 years in the tire industry. Every Costco in our service area could get s minimum of 3 daily deliveries during the week. Not only would the counterman not see if he could get the tires for that day, he would not even check availability. Politely, though.. with a sh*t eating phoney grin on his face. See, I know how their ordering process works, and it would have taken 2 minutes to get an answer. I am NOT renewing my Costco membership (not traveling all that way anymore), but this solidified my decision. We went to the Walmart tire center in Hudson, were treated really nicely by the young Lady at the counter, and had the tires on the car the next morning. Costco....DONE!"

Not only would the counterman not see if he could get the tires for that day, he would not even check availability. Politely, though.. with a sh*t eating phoney grin on his face. See, I know how their ordering process works, and it would have taken 2 minutes to get an answer. I am NOT renewing my Costco membership (not traveling all that way anymore), but this solidified my decision. We went to the Walmart tire center in Hudson, were treated really nicely by the young Lady at the counter, and had the tires on the car the next morning. Costco....DONE!"
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",5,7/15/11,"What's not to love about Costco!  I'm from Los Angeles and it seems like every time I go to a new place, one of the first things to do, is find the nearest Costco!This location was up to par with all the other ones I've been to.  It's large, spacious, lots of parking, workers are friendly/polite, and you can get all your favorite items.I was in a bit of a hurry this time, so I only got bananas, two boxes of cereal (have you tried the Oatmeal Squares? very good), lunch meat combination, and sea salt potato chips.  Yea!Prices are about the same as other locations in California.  Costco is excellent!TIP:  No gas station at this location.Xie Xie!!"

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",5,12/16/18,"Trader Joe's has become my favorite supermarket ever. Even more than Stop&Shop, and I was SO loyal to Stop&Shop! What about Trader Joe's makes it far above the rest, you ask. There are so many things! 1. Variety. They make all their own stuff, and not everything is spectacular, but once you go here, you'll come back for a specific variety of your grocery shopping. I buy tons of snacks here. The giant bags of white cheddar corn puffs, the chocolatey chip cookies, the cinnamon letter cookies, animal crackers, etc. Especially around the holiday season when they have those special Peppermint Oreo's that are to die for. Other items sold here in the bakery and frozen food department are also great, it goes far above and beyond the snacks. 2. Prices. They stay the same and are reasonable. I come out of a Trader Joe's nearly every Sunday with around twenty dollars of snacks that lasts an entire week of munching all afternoons. The prices are also accurate... their are no discrepancies in pricing since their are no sales and therefore no ways for consumers to be overcharged (a pet peeve of mine that is constantly an issue with other large grocery stores). 3. Convenience. I am in and out of here within five minutes EVERY time I shop. I always purchase the same exact things here and therefore every time I come here I will be in and out within five minutes or less (this is not a joke, this is honest). Lines are never long and the thing it will take the longest to do here is park! 4. Reliability. Shelves are always fully stocked and they always have everything I'm looking for. While I love all the TJ locations I've been to, I will say that the Needham Trader Joe's has had empty shelves a few times in the past. On some occasions they have been able to get the item from the back for me, but this place always has fully stocked shelves. 5. Staff. At every Trader Joe's, everyone is always so friendly and full of energy. They have a fabulous crew of associates that all enjoy their job and show it! This specific one does a great business with a full parking lot nearly all the time, but still manages to fill the needs of low prices, short checkout lines and fully stocked shelves all the time (no exceptions!). Love their dedication to Newton. 5 stars always, Trader Joe's is a must if you have never been before. Expect the unexpected from the typical grocery stores!"
Dee F.,"Waltham, MA",5,4/29/20,"I have been impressed with this Trader Joe's, especially during these challenging times.  I find them to be very well organized with their outdoor lines, their inventory is usually well stocked (even at the end of the day), and kudos for everything they do to try to keep people safe.  I like that they spray down the shopping carts (not just the handles, but the full carts), the store is clean and always smells of disinfectant, their friendly associates wear masks and gloves, and they do a good job marking up the floors to try to keep people going in one direction.  However, since it is a small store, all it takes is one person to go the wrong way down an aisle to come very close to someone, and it happens during every trip.  Not the store's fault, but since they always have a lot of associates on the floor it would be nice if they could provide ""friendly reminders"" of the importance of following their nicely laid out arrows."

Someone was there to direct the flow of traffic on this very busy Wednesday before Thanksgiving ... It was quite chilly yet he did his job with a sense of humor and a smile on his face . I love this location .... it's just the right size to navigate when you want to get in out and on with life . Employees are always friendly approachable and knowledgeable which is so much appreciated now a days Thank You TJ in W Newton keep up the great work
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",5,12/16/18,"Trader Joe's has become my favorite supermarket ever. Even more than Stop&Shop, and I was SO loyal to Stop&Shop! What about Trader Joe's makes it far above the rest, you ask. There are so many things! 1. Variety. They make all their own stuff, and not everything is spectacular, but once you go here, you'll come back for a specific variety of your grocery shopping. I buy tons of snacks here. The giant bags of white cheddar corn puffs, the chocolatey chip cookies, the cinnamon letter cookies, animal crackers, etc. Especially around the holiday season when they have those special Peppermint Oreo's that are to die for. Other items sold here in the bakery and frozen food department are also great, it goes far above and beyond the snacks. 2. Prices. They stay the same and are reasonable. I come out of a Trader Joe's nearly every Sunday with around twenty dollars of snacks that lasts an entire week of munching all afternoons. The prices are also accurate... their are no discrepancies in pricing since their are no sales and therefore no ways for consumers to be overcharged (a pet peeve of mine that is constantly an issue with other large grocery stores). 3. Convenience. I am in and out of here within five minutes EVERY time I shop. I always purchase the same exact things here and therefore every time I come here I will be in and out within five minutes or less (this is not a joke, this is honest). Lines are never long and the thing it will take the longest to do here is park! 4. Reliability. Shelves are always fully stocked and they always have everything I'm looking for. While I love all the TJ locations I've been to, I will say that the Needham Trader Joe's has had empty shelves a few times in the past. On some occasions they have been able to get the item from the back for me, but this place always has fully stocked shelves. 5. Staff. At every Trader Joe's, everyone is always so friendly and full of energy. They have a fabulous crew of associates that all enjoy their job and show it! This specific one does a great business with a full parking lot nearly all the time, but still manages to fill the needs of low prices, short checkout lines and fully stocked shelves all the time (no exceptions!). Love their dedication to Newton. 5 stars always, Trader Joe's is a must if you have never been before. Expect the unexpected from the typical grocery stores!"
Dee F.,"Waltham, MA",5,4/29/20,"I have been impressed with this Trader Joe's, especially during these challenging times.  I find them to be very well organized with their outdoor lines, their inventory is usually well stocked (even at the end of the day), and kudos for everything they do to try to keep people safe.  I like that they spray down the shopping carts (not just the handles, but the full carts), the store is clean and always smells of disinfectant, their friendly associates wear masks and gloves, and they do a good job marking up the floors to try to keep people going in one direction.  However, since it is a small store, all it takes is one person to go the wrong way down an aisle to come very close to someone, and it happens during every trip.  Not the store's fault, but since they always have a lot of associates on the floor it would be nice if they could provide ""friendly reminders"" of the importance of following their nicely laid out arrows."
Roman E.,"Boston, MA",1,11/18/18,"Good is an acceptable answer to ""how are you"" almost anywhere you go, unless its first family its pretty much like visa gold its accepted everywhere...everywhere but TRADER JOES!!! ughhhhhhh god... if any of them ask you how are you at the line... RUN..  if you tell them good... uh uh ... good is not an acceptable answer for trader joe employees... and they will reply with ""just good sir"" they want to exactly just how the f%% your doing. They want supporting sentences and a strong finish as well as a citation page they want to know your summer plans and if your doing anything fun this season? . ..i made the error this time by replying that i was  good when asked how are you. I was cheerful and decided to answer, its my fault and i take full responsibility, and will revert back to my usual  "" me no speaki engli"""
Asta S.,"Boston, MA",5,7/4/18,"I'm not sure how it gets better than this. Every time I try a new product, I forget about buying it elsewhere and start buying it here. Soy sauce? Yup. Soap? Yup. Adore the lemon verbena scent! I love their cookies, especially the maple leaf sugar ones. SUPER friendly and helpful staff puts this location heads above the rest.  They also seem to be on top of their replenishment of stock, which makes it even better. Now, just bring back the mango granola and my life will be complete!"
Suzanne F.,"Boston, MA",5,5/25/17,"I've been going here for ten years. Everyone's always super friendly and the cashiers are even conversational!The prices are great, as is the selection - I particularly like their frozen food offerings. There are probably dozens of frozen foods you could buy and then stick in the oven for a fast and delicious dinner. I am partial to the spinach spanikopita (sp?).Yes the parking is a little different with the 2 lots, but it's really not bad - I never have to wait for a spot. Oh, and they have great inexpensive floral bouquets, too (do you hear me Whole Foods???)"
TheNotoriusB1g ..,"Ashfield, MA",3,9/8/18,"It's fine, most of the things they sell are knock offs of actual things, and they have a lot of natural food like fruit and vegetables. But, the reason why I made this a 3 star rating is because when I was about 9, I tried    To get some mini ice cream cones, and they denied me of my mini ice cream cones."
Liz B.,"Newton, MA",5,12/14/17,"I have been going to this location for 13 years - many employees (very kind) have been around for years!  It's a great store, yes it's on the small side and the parking can be tough but it's got everything and it's easy to navigate.  Good prices, good people."
Sae R.,"Attleboro, MA",5,10/17/17,"I drive an hour to get to Trader Joe's, I'm addicted. Yesterday, I had the kindest man named George ring up my groceries. As I was checking out he let me know about the new flavors dog biscuits coming, and that there would be a new flavor of cough drops coming soon too. You could tell he loved engaging the costumers and takes his job seriously. I'll be back for sure."
Steve K.,"Arlington, VA",3,7/24/16,"It is Trader Joe's, so the quality is very good. But this one is very small and cramped. If it's the convenient option then that works but all things equal I'd go to a different location."
Jennifer G.,"Newton, MA",4,8/19/17,"Really friendly people, and easy to navigate store. The only part I dislike is the cramped parking situation.. Once in awhile I'll even park on Washington Street and just walk across to the store because I don't want to deal with the stress of the parking lot. That being said, at least this lot has two sides whereas  one in Coolidge Corner is more hectic than this one. I really like the store overall, I think there's a friendly vibe and a lot of great products and if you can go to at less crowded times it's helpful."
Dawn M.,"Boston, MA",5,2/25/17,"I love all Trader Joes, but this location is my favorite. The staff is helpful, friendly, and always available. They were giving away peanut brittle today! I shop here regularly, and on the weekends, and have had no issues with parking.  It's a smaller TJs but they have what I need."
Kim K.,"Somerville, MA",3,5/15/15,"Small and cramped, but I can't complain about my go-to staples from TJs. Parking is tough too. Staff are very friendly!"
Perri V.,"Boston, MA",4,10/15/15,"What's not to like about TJs? It has all the delicious things you could ever want to eat and it doesn't break the bank. Great for snacks and frozen food (and pumpkin flavored things, if you're into that). The only reason I can't give it five stars is the parking situation- very cramped and difficult."
Jonathan P.,"Boston, MA",4,4/19/20,"**COVID19 Ready**This TJ is great! I usually go at random times during the week so my perspective may different to some other reviewers who go during peak hours (which I don't recommend for any grocery runs)-Pros:--TJ Associates waits outside, wipes carts/basket from customers after they unload into their cars.--Store is relatively well stocked except meat section (which I'm seeing with other supermarkets I've been to)--Check-out lines are never too long, with place holders to ensure it doesn't extend into the food aisles--Associates are still friendly and helpful with any questions/issues you may have--Associates have cloth masks + gloves and does their best to keep it well stocked and keep a healthy distance away from customers and fellow associates.-Cons:--Store is pretty small (like other TJs) so even with one other person in a single food aisle, it's hard to get what you're looking for without getting close with them. Thank you to all the essential employees keeping our society going during these times!"
Grace R.,"Boston, MA",5,5/19/20,"I've been impressed with how well TJs has handled the coronavirus restrictions.  As always, the staff are positive, warm and friendly.  They wipe down every cart and do a great job of managing customer traffic in the store.  And as always, the staff is consistently helpful; if you are looking for something they will stop what they are doing and help you find it, or find out if/when it would be available.  Such a pleasure to shop here!"
Michael A.,"Newton Highlands, MA",5,9/13/20,"The staff here at Trader Joe's really put their heart and soul and helping each customer. This Trader Joe's could be a case study on how to run a business. Obviously they have good management which produces happy employees which are happy to help the customers.In case you don't know, a lot of the frozen meals are of the highest quality. If you Google Trader Joe's frozen meals you'll find a top ones. Not only are they delicious they're healthy. The samosas the dumplings the thin pizzas are all very good."
Robert G.,"Newton Centre, MA",2,4/17/20,"Senior Hour - 8-9AM is well managed, but utilizes the store at full capacity. Newton (and near-by Waltham) is an older demographic, so this heavy, and continued use is not surprising.The marked sidewalk social-distancing places are filled by 7:45. Once the store opens about 25 (or so) people are let in and then additional shoppers are let in as others leave. The parking lot is full by 8AM and stays full. It appears line wait-time is 20-30 minutes.  The situation is self-regulating as with the parking lot full or nearly full, newly-arriving prospective shoppers look around and then just leave. Everybody is wearing masks and behaving well, but there are probably better Trader Joes to patronize just now.  I'd suggest the unfortunately (and aspirationally) located Allston TJs.  It has underground parking and therefore a more comfortable wait space. Allston  also has a wine and beer section. (Brookline and Needham likely have the same demographic issues as Newton The Allston TJs also exists in the heart of Boston's student area - which has been additionally decimated by the university closings. The Senior Hours are: 9-10AM."
Sadie F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,2/13/19,"Shout-out to the cashier who noticed the blemished/heavily bruised and overripe banana I was about to purchase in the check-out line and asked me if I wanted it. I said no and thanked them for noticing and politely asking me about it! They asked if I wanted to grab another one. I was fine with what I had :)Friendly, polite, honest, and thoughtful employees; excellent prices for high quality products, clean store, never crowded (at least when I visit), and great parking makes for an easy and pleasant grocery shopping experience."
Rachael G.,"Waltham, MA",5,10/11/18,"Something happened today that made my day. I was at your store and was checking out. It started to raining hard outside and said, ""oh darn Harlow, I left the umbrella in the car, we're going to get wet."" Samantha, the checkout girl, said, ""We have umbrellas in the store and I could walk you outside and hold the umbrella so you can load your groceries and your baby doesn't get wet."" I happily obliged. This was one of the sweetest moments I have had with a stranger. Her unparalleled kindness and generosity to help a mother out with her baby. Thank you Samantha, you put faith in me that there are still humble and kind people out there."

Thida P.,"Boston, MA",3,9/15/20,"This is a small Trader Joe's and they have a small parking lot that they share with two other businesses.  During this time of Covid, they make it one way down the aisles and if you accidentally go down the wrong way down the aisle then you'll get yelled at even though there's no one else in the aisle/lane with you except for the staff member who caught you.  My bad! I also got yelled at for not standing in the red box while standing at the check out. Damn! I felt like a little kid on this grocery trip. Definitely a safe place to go shopping at because they enforce all the safety pandemic rules.I came right at 9am and it wasn't bad. Not sure how crazy it would be during the busy hours."
Ted D.,"Lexington, MA",3,7/20/20,"This is a small location which, like many Trader Joes, has a parking problem. You should also be aware that it is now impossible to stop in and pick up an item or two without waiting in a line that winds completely around the store (due to Covid aisle arrows). Staff will be unforgiving if, for whatever reason, you need to swim upstream for anything."
Allison B.,"Arlington, MA",5,3/22/20,"My little neighborhood Trader Joe's is great.  It's on the smaller side, and the parking lot can be a s*$t show during busy hours, but it's got all the usual basic Trader Joe's awesome items at great prices.  Staff members are super friendly overall and helpful when I can't find something.  This is unusual in a grocery store (or any store) these days.  I enjoy shopping here."
Ann R.,"Watertown, MA",3,8/16/19,"Trader Joe's in Arlington has some pretty good food at reasonable prices.  Parking is a little hectic like a lot of other places.  My big complaint is the very loud music which I think is unnecessary in a small supermarket.   Not sure if it is still loud-haven't been there in over a year. Hopefully the next time I go, the music will be much softer for the middle age folks like myself."
Terri G.,"Somerville, MA",1,12/30/19,"On the 27th oF dec I popped in for a few appetizers for unexpected company.  The tasting station was serving something up so I quickly went over and waited for the man to turn around and acknowledge me. I said ""smells good what are you serving today ?"" He waved his hand toward the display and said THAT.   He then turned his back on me again.  I waited a minute until it was clear he was not going to oFfer me a taste. So I left.  If you don't want me to shop there keep it up."
Mmm D.,"Boston, MA",1,8/12/18,*Hisses like a spooky Halloween cat*The devil lurks through the aisles of trader joe. I've seen him with my one good eye. I don't believe in the devil or Jesus Christ lord and savior until today. I think that the ground beef has been poisoned or it just doo doo.
Heidi F.,"Boston, MA",1,10/15/18,"I wish this place had a warmer vibe. I have enjoyed both East Coast and West Coast Trader Joe's. West Coast, SoCal are some of the greats; people are friendly, helpful, and get to know the customers; I have a ""Trader Joe's family' when I shop there.HERE, in Arlington, I sense that it is long aged out burnt grass which the owners continue to water with zero results.I will start with the tasting station, normally a source of excitement (especially if you're with your children), a source of joy (can I eat one more!!), and just plain fun (what is Trader Joe's cooking up this time which I will buy for dinner/snack/over indulgence) I HAVE NEVER, NOT ONCE, PURCHASED extra products when I visit the Arlington store due to my excitement, joy, or fun related to the tasting station. It is Iike I am being watched by the principal who is just waiting for me to make a mistake and smack my knuckles with a ruler. I will stop there.The management of this store needs an infusion of training, or a new store, or to visit SoCal, or Cambridge (a well oiled machine with relatively happy peeps willing to smile, offer an extra tasting station nibble not only to the kiddos but to the big kid adults, oh, did I mention the coffee samples? Cambridge will be my go to now (even though Arlington is closer), because Arlington just deflates my balloon, brings down my day, and overall misses the Trader Joe mark.  Is anyone listening? Arlington Trader Joe's need an overhaul and a grand re-opening. I'll come take a peek then."
Alice L.,"Arlington, MA",3,12/28/17,"Not my favorite TJs. I come here out of convenience because it's on the way home from work, but what's the point when you can't find what you're looking for? On two occasions I needed broccoli for a recipe and they were out of broccoli. Like other Yelpers mentioned, parking sucks and spots are tiny. The staff is always friendly and that's not the problem."
Laura A.,"Watertown, MA",4,5/12/18,"Very friendly staff!  I love this location! Trader Joe's continues to have all of our family staples (bread, milk, affordable meat, products without high fructose, and a small selection of beauty products). The variety and quality of produce could be better, but other than that I love it there."
Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",3,12/18/14,"I never thought I'd find another Trader Joe's whose parking lot can be as challenging to negotiate as the one in Albany, NY.  This one shares a parking lot with Walgreens next door, and the lot is too small to accommodate both conveniently. Negotiate carefully.Once you deal with that, the store is fine, though it is slightly smaller than the average TJ's. It wasn't obvious to me that they've compromised a lot on the products carried, but it's evident when you check out.  The cashiers are friendly and extremely talkative. That's quite nice, EXCEPT when the lines are backed up, in which case you might not be so enthusiastic about your cashier casually chit-chatting with every customer in front of you. So if you can endure the parking and a chatty cashier, you'll be fine here, because it's still Trader Joe's, and it's still good."
Suzy N.,"Winchester, MA",2,3/19/19,"The cashier had a coffee cup sitting on the counter and he spilled the cup over my groceries. He tried wiping it up with a box a tissues but everything was still wet. Got no apologies and now my hands smell of coffee putting my groceries away. Don't get me wrong, I like coffee but not on my salmon and oranges. Next time please tell your employees not to place their open drinks on the checkout counter"
Jo Y.,"Alexandria, VA",3,4/19/17,"Parking in this location is truly terrible - so I park on the street and walk to the store. The store itself is ""Ok"", not the best TJ's, not the worst. Staff are great but what bothers the crap out of me is that for some reason very shoppers here seem to bring their own shopping bags. At other locations almost everyone does and other stores have lots of those ""helpful/passive-aggressive"" signs to remind shoppers to bring their bags. Arlington is supposedly full of enlightened folks who care deeply about the environment but they're lazy as hell when it comes to bringing their own bags! Paper or plastic - NEITHER. Bring your own dammit! And to the store Manager, remember that time I talked to you about this and you *agreed* and said you'd make sure you got more signs up? That was a year ago."
Brian C.,"Cambridge, MA",4,4/8/18,"This place is great! The staff are really nice. It's a small store but good if you just need a few essentials. Plus, the play the best music from the 80s..."
M B.,"Davis, CA",5,1/25/18,"All my groceries come from trader Joe's. Because the store is so compact, I can fill my car and get out again in fifteen minutes. I also appreciate the limited selection because the food tends to match my preferences: generally healthy, few ingredients I don't like. Most stores waste my time with 12 different Cheerios to choose from. Here, I just grab the one kind they sell and move on."
Kenny P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,1/19/16,"I love Trader Joes! They have helpful staff, affordable/fresh food and it's located right off the Minuteman Trail!  Here's why I gave this one three stars instead of five:1. Terrible parking lot2. TERRIBLE PARKING LOT3. They run out of stuff - probably because it's small4. Selection is limited compared to other stores - once again probably because it's small5. No alcohol here =("
Steve A.,"Newtonville, MA",5,10/18/17,"My favorite Trader Joes in all of Boston! I drive out here for the more spacious interior and less crowded shopping experience. I like to be able to pick out my cans of organic black beans in near solitude! The parking situation is a challenge. But that's what you get for being right on the heartbeat of Massachusetts Avenue! Best time to come is a week day at 10am, after the morning commute, and right before all the stay-at-homes descend to do their weekly shopping."
Phil C.,"Boston, MA",4,5/30/13,"It's not big, it doesn't have alcohol, but this TJ's tries to do good with what it has. The customer service is the what you'd expect from a TJ's: well-above average for a grocery store. This TJ's has all the other products that you'd see regularly. The drawback to this location is that the parking lot is tiny, and can be difficult to negotiate. The lot is shared with a Walgreens, which doesn't help either. Sometimes it's just to park on the street nearby.TJ's aren't that big in general, so don't expect a Wegmans experience. However, the former's got good and refined products at reasonable prices, with solid customer service."

Jo Y.,"Alexandria, VA",3,4/19/17,"Parking in this location is truly terrible - so I park on the street and walk to the store. The store itself is ""Ok"", not the best TJ's, not the worst. Staff are great but what bothers the crap out of me is that for some reason very shoppers here seem to bring their own shopping bags. At other locations almost everyone does and other stores have lots of those ""helpful/passive-aggressive"" signs to remind shoppers to bring their bags. Arlington is supposedly full of enlightened folks who care deeply about the environment but they're lazy as hell when it comes to bringing their own bags! Paper or plastic - NEITHER. Bring your own dammit! And to the store Manager, remember that time I talked to you about this and you *agreed* and said you'd make sure you got more signs up? That was a year ago."

Thida P.,"Boston, MA",3,9/15/20,"This is a small Trader Joe's and they have a small parking lot that they share with two other businesses.  During this time of Covid, they make it one way down the aisles and if you accidentally go down the wrong way down the aisle then you'll get yelled at even though there's no one else in the aisle/lane with you except for the staff member who caught you.  My bad! I also got yelled at for not standing in the red box while standing at the check out. Damn! I felt like a little kid on this grocery trip. Definitely a safe place to go shopping at because they enforce all the safety pandemic rules.I came right at 9am and it wasn't bad. Not sure how crazy it would be during the busy hours."
Ted D.,"Lexington, MA",3,7/20/20,"This is a small location which, like many Trader Joes, has a parking problem. You should also be aware that it is now impossible to stop in and pick up an item or two without waiting in a line that winds completely around the store (due to Covid aisle arrows). Staff will be unforgiving if, for whatever reason, you need to swim upstream for anything."
Allison B.,"Arlington, MA",5,3/22/20,"My little neighborhood Trader Joe's is great.  It's on the smaller side, and the parking lot can be a s*$t show during busy hours, but it's got all the usual basic Trader Joe's awesome items at great prices.  Staff members are super friendly overall and helpful when I can't find something.  This is unusual in a grocery store (or any store) these days.  I enjoy shopping here."
Ann R.,"Watertown, MA",3,8/16/19,"Trader Joe's in Arlington has some pretty good food at reasonable prices.  Parking is a little hectic like a lot of other places.  My big complaint is the very loud music which I think is unnecessary in a small supermarket.   Not sure if it is still loud-haven't been there in over a year. Hopefully the next time I go, the music will be much softer for the middle age folks like myself."
Terri G.,"Somerville, MA",1,12/30/19,"On the 27th oF dec I popped in for a few appetizers for unexpected company.  The tasting station was serving something up so I quickly went over and waited for the man to turn around and acknowledge me. I said ""smells good what are you serving today ?"" He waved his hand toward the display and said THAT.   He then turned his back on me again.  I waited a minute until it was clear he was not going to oFfer me a taste. So I left.  If you don't want me to shop there keep it up."
Mmm D.,"Boston, MA",1,8/12/18,*Hisses like a spooky Halloween cat*The devil lurks through the aisles of trader joe. I've seen him with my one good eye. I don't believe in the devil or Jesus Christ lord and savior until today. I think that the ground beef has been poisoned or it just doo doo.
Heidi F.,"Boston, MA",1,10/15/18,"I wish this place had a warmer vibe. I have enjoyed both East Coast and West Coast Trader Joe's. West Coast, SoCal are some of the greats; people are friendly, helpful, and get to know the customers; I have a ""Trader Joe's family' when I shop there.HERE, in Arlington, I sense that it is long aged out burnt grass which the owners continue to water with zero results.I will start with the tasting station, normally a source of excitement (especially if you're with your children), a source of joy (can I eat one more!!), and just plain fun (what is Trader Joe's cooking up this time which I will buy for dinner/snack/over indulgence) I HAVE NEVER, NOT ONCE, PURCHASED extra products when I visit the Arlington store due to my excitement, joy, or fun related to the tasting station. It is Iike I am being watched by the principal who is just waiting for me to make a mistake and smack my knuckles with a ruler. I will stop there.The management of this store needs an infusion of training, or a new store, or to visit SoCal, or Cambridge (a well oiled machine with relatively happy peeps willing to smile, offer an extra tasting station nibble not only to the kiddos but to the big kid adults, oh, did I mention the coffee samples? Cambridge will be my go to now (even though Arlington is closer), because Arlington just deflates my balloon, brings down my day, and overall misses the Trader Joe mark.  Is anyone listening? Arlington Trader Joe's need an overhaul and a grand re-opening. I'll come take a peek then."
Alice L.,"Arlington, MA",3,12/28/17,"Not my favorite TJs. I come here out of convenience because it's on the way home from work, but what's the point when you can't find what you're looking for? On two occasions I needed broccoli for a recipe and they were out of broccoli. Like other Yelpers mentioned, parking sucks and spots are tiny. The staff is always friendly and that's not the problem."
Laura A.,"Watertown, MA",4,5/12/18,"Very friendly staff!  I love this location!

Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",3,12/18/14,"I never thought I'd find another Trader Joe's whose parking lot can be as challenging to negotiate as the one in Albany, NY.  This one shares a parking lot with Walgreens next door, and the lot is too small to accommodate both conveniently. Negotiate carefully.Once you deal with that, the store is fine, though it is slightly smaller than the average TJ's. It wasn't obvious to me that they've compromised a lot on the products carried, but it's evident when you check out.  The cashiers are friendly and extremely talkative. That's quite nice, EXCEPT when the lines are backed up, in which case you might not be so enthusiastic about your cashier casually chit-chatting with every customer in front of you.

Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/16/20,"Big shout out to TJ's staff for their continued pleasant, friendly and upbeat services. Have to say, their music selections are totally awesome -  which contributes to the positive energy in the store. It is especially gratifying to shop there through these days of COVID19. It's stressful going out these days. However, I actually look forward to marketing at TJ's."
Sarah O.,"Boston, MA",5,8/22/20,"""This place is like a candy store with a few essentials.""- literally just overheard someone in the checkout line say thisI'm always so impressed at how friendly and ready to help TJ's associates are. Never had a bad experience.Prices are always unexpectedly lower than you would expect for such high quality, delicious food. Whether to buy flowers is a question when I go to the grocery store because, although they're pretty and cheery, they're pricey. Not at TJ's though. Today I bought Gerber daisies to add a pop of color and brightness and it didn't break the bank.Today I was impressed that at the door there is an associate spraying everyone's hands with hand sanitizer before they enter. What a great idea!"
Emily L.,"Boston, MA",5,12/4/19,"So many great items at trader joes! Loved their shrimp cake but they stopped making it. Always on the look out for other delicious items like their yuzu soda. Kids can look for stuffed animals and get a small prize if they tell one of their staff where it is. Also, can request a kiddie size shopping cart to make it a more fun experience for them."
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",4,3/5/20,"Trader Joe's is always great for all basic snacks, and the best of taste typically in bakery and meats. This location, like all others, didn't disappoint. While it would be nice to have a larger parking lot that isn't full to the brim and is consistently jammed, I guess it should be lucky to have one at all being that this is Cambridge. Selection was very plentiful. The store was super busy and even on a busy Sunday afternoon many people were filling the shelves. Everything I wanted was in stock, and even though some of the other Trader Joe's locations I visit are less busy, some seem to be more frequently out of stock of certain items.The meats here looked fresh and the staff were friendly. Plenty of checkout lanes open on a Sunday. Good store. Would highly suggest, always a benefit if you can come here on off hours though as parking is a struggle. 4 stars."
Paul Z.,"Belmont, MA",5,11/21/19,Great TJs. I go there after work during the week and it's rarely crowded. They are always well stocked and the staff if always friendly and seemingly happy. Parking lot can be a bit of a cluster at times but I've been to TJs in other cities where you have to wait in line to park so whatever.
Nic C.,"Arlington, MA",4,11/1/19,Love this Trader Joe's! I am always coming in here for fresh produce and frozen food. The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when they're busy. The sample area is always welcoming even when I would prefer not to sample lol. Other tj's seem like they don't want to give you samples but not this one! The parking lot is a total shit show I have been backed into multiple times (side note if 2 cars back up into each other no one is at fault pet insurance) and due to the location homeless people tend to hang around and set up shop around the Dunks but this is still my fav Trader Joe's. I recommend going in off peak hours!
Ros S.,"Belmont, MA",1,10/8/19,"I took my auntie to grocery shopping today to my TJ , it was  and  at the same time.A young women Sara wasn't helpful to us at all, I am so disappointed, all the top service that I had received over the years in this location is gone. I understand bad days but this was plain rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.Shocking to see this behavior in such a wonderful store. 10 for the store 0 for her service."
Valeria S.,"Somerville, MA",5,7/9/18,"Love going to this Trader Joe's. It's larger than than the one in Boston or in Cambridge. Sometimes there can be a bit of people specially during the weekends but nothing too crazy. I've never had to wait long to check out.I love the little samples they always have, some have been so good I've bought the actual item. The coffee is also a nice little touch to have while shopping. Aside from the service the staff is super friendly and really helpful!"
W. A.,"Cambridge, MA",2,1/27/18,mass.gov/service-details…This store does not post the legal signs for price accuracy. Once again they scanned an item higher than the posted price. They corrected the price when I pointed it out at checkout. They did not offer or provide one item free which the law requires. Why doesn't this store comply with the law?
Court S.,"Oakland, CA",4,10/17/14,"In my last review I complained about the awful parking spots. I need to write an update to inform folks reading this that I've been humbled. I recently moved to FL and the closet TJ's is 40mi away. Yes the closest. Smh. I absolutely love this store and all it's products and employees. Every time I visit and every store I shop in has very nice employees. Now that it's pumpkin season there are so many deliciously seasoned pumpkin themed items. I'm super stoked! My faves are the pumpkin waffles, spiced granola and pumpkin ice cream. I'm also a fan of the Trader Joe's app because it highlights featured items and gives recipe suggestions. Ahhh how I love this store!"
Nicholas H.,"Montreal, Canada",5,3/28/18,"I want to give a huge shout out to Matt, Claire, and Trader Joe's in General. My wife and I frequently shop at the Trader Joe's Alewife location in Cambridge, MA. Today I called the location wondering if they do flower delivery as my wife works across the street. Today is our two year anniversary. Matt not only offered to make an exception and do a delivery which they do not normally do, but would not take my money for payment! He said that it was ""for love"" and that they're just happy to have us as customers. Naturally, my wife was blown away and thrilled with the flowers! Thank you so much to everyone that made this happen! You've made lifelong customers out of us with service that goes leaps and bounds above the norm! Sincerely, a loyal customer! :)"
Jordan M.,"Cambridge, MA",5,6/1/17,"Extremely good products for very good prices. My wife and I had no idea how awesome Trader Joe's was until we moved to Cambridge. A lot of their products are way cheaper than similar alternatives elsewhere. I was particularly surprised by the ground beef. The store is always well stocked, well staffed and very clean. Everyone is very friendly and look like they enjoy their jobs and they always ensure you have had a good experience. Would recommend this place to everyone. It's definitely a way cheaper alternative to Whole Foods."
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",5,11/2/18,I just realized that Trader Joe's are the same across the US! I noticed the East Coast stores house the produce away from the front doors a tad. Shopping today took me just a few minutes... same as back home. Ahhhh national chains;))
Amy X.,"Boston, MA",5,2/2/16,"This will be your go to place if you are any of the following: - Want fresh produce similar to Whole Foods Quality but way cheaper;- Food that appears and tastes better than Star Market/Market Basket;- A self proclaimed (or wannabee) snack junkie.I mean seriously, for the price, selection, and service, (not to mention the free sampling), I can't think of a better grocery. Not comparing this to any specialty stores."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9/15/14,"I, too, am surprised by the negative reviews of the employees here. I've been frequenting this TJs since it opened and my interaction as well as observations of the employees have been nothing short of wonderful (with the exception of one: the tall guy named Dave. He's rude to everyone and I would rather wait in line that has 10 people with carts full of groceries than go to his register and deal with his rudeness).The store is always in order and well stocked and if there's something you're looking for but can't find they go out of the way to look around the shelves (sometimes they reorganize and put it somewhere else) or check the back to see if it's about to be restocked. The prices are super reasonable and they have a lot of unique items. If you're interested in a product but not sure if you'd like it, you can take it to the demo station and they'll open it and give you a sample.Ignore the negative reviews bcz they're probably about the tall pale guy Dave. There will always be one bad apple in a bunch, toss it aside, pretend it doesn't exist, and feast your eyes upon the glorious bunch. Everyone there is a delight and sometimes go out of their way to make you smile."
Heather O.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/10/14,"I do not understand the negative reviews about the staff here. The staff at this TJs goes above and beyond!Once I asked the worker if the peanut butter and jelly chocolate was good. He said ""I dont know, here lets split one and try it, on me"" (it was in fact delicious)Another time I sighed out loud so the worker was asking what was up. I mentioned I was moving and changing my job all in the same week and the stress was taking a toll on me. As I was cashing out she disappeared and brought me a sunflower as a present. It made my day! SO nice of her.I always have great experiences here and find the staff exceptionally nice and helpful. This is the best TJs ever!"
Beth N.,"Medford, MA",1,8/20/17,"Geez. Please tell me why grocery stores like the trader joes chain stores are one of the worst environments to do your grocery shopping. I am just looking for a local trader joe near where I live to get a few good value buys. You know.I am looking for a pleasant environment, cashiers that do a decent job,and no over kill. Meaning, the people in the store do not criticize other persons in public,Ie: try to humiliate them for whatever reason.Does any such store exist here in the state of Mass. ? Where they exhibit good behavior ?Yeah. Today was really a lousy experience for me . But it was lousy last weekas well. Two times, two lousy experiences at the same location. I just needed to pick up a few things, you know, the things that I like to stock in my shelves.Hmm. Why were these people soooo rude, I wonder.In my experience, I would need to ask these people, why are you here?As to the role and responsibilty of the workers, one would think, perhaps,to promote a decent shopping trip, or experience for all.That would mean, Fairness, Equality, Non judgemental behavior, behavior that is non critical, Unbiased, and Non prejudiced.Ehem. I can repeat those words. As that goes for the People, ie : public shoppers in there. As well. All the while,This was during ""the big free speech rally on the Boston common.""As we are talking about Behavioral problems .And the lacking therein, of any sign of human decent Behavior. Towards others. Anti-social behavior, Rudeness, Abhorent snobbery. Unkindness. Makes me want to Puke in their faces.These people are just every day people. Not protestors, orfree speech groups, not groups of that sort. Just everyday shoppers.Hmm. Such a waste. Of a human being's time to have to spend any time at allin their company. In the company of such Rude twarts.This is not the store's fault. These are just some of the other customers.A sampling. As Then, we could look at the actual Cashier Job. What is the job of a grocery clerk/ cashier ? Ie: Check people out  at the register ?So, let me go on. There are customers Then there are employees.The function of a grocery store check out is not all that difficult to grasp.Cash handling. So, in the case of any of a person beingSo rude, and So obnoxious ? Especially if it happens to be in the case if the employee?Not working. Should b fired. They are not working, and need to be sent home.The customer doesnt need to do anything except take care of herself .The customer doesnt need to help anyone. Except themself.The employee who acts out, is rude and disrespectful ought to be firedfor not doing their job. Plain and simple.Are they in fact the reason why their customersAre so rude ? Are they acting just like these rude customers, in fact ?Or is it part of the training ?What is really going on. ?Just what do they think they can do here  ?Do they really need to expect me to do anything for themExcept mind my own business, get what I need and get the Hell out of that hellhole crap sham shak ? Is rudeness included in the job description.?Any sign of that, rudeness, etc., either on the register, or just being around, shows that someone is not really doing their job.And not doing a good job is the same as not working period.There is no place for such displays of dysfunctionality when there is a job that people, the customers, needs and depends upon.Other than that, maybe I need to ask them, is ""ringing a cow bell"" in a personsEardrums again, part of the Sham ? I find that to be cruel and Abusive Torture.As to their products. 1. Do you really want to Overkill our bodies with Junk food,High sugar, and salt overload and other generic crap food ? That being said, 2. Do you have a problem with allowing people to read labels, aand shop for what they need at their own pace , which is expected when youare paying for something and buying something that would be for your own diet needs??- --is that labeled as""crazy""; --by the people who work thereAnd promote this kind of attitude of gang warfare within ? Or are they aimed on focusing and targeting a person whom theyassume would have money and bs them into buying crap to make Them happy.?And help out with sales ???Also is this part of that same training stragegy ?Rather than that of providing  customers with a pleasant  shopping experience ???--Sorry. I did not realize if that is what it was.A sham. So sorry."

A R.,"Cambridge, MA",5,8/12/17,"Great quality items for a modest price.  Excellent chocolate, olive oil, cheese, almond milk, fruit, veg.  Produce more limited than some groceries, but enough choice for me.  Usually have organic oprions available.  Plus, I've discovered things I would not have thought yo look for if they didn't have it.Staff is the best! -- well trained, very friendly, efficient.  I've never seen grocery store staff so friendly and cheerful anywhere else."
Patricia H.,"Medford, MA",5,3/29/20,"As always, Trader Joe's has good products, reasonable prices, nice staff. Extra kudos for having senior hours during the pandemic & actually enforcing them. Other stores in the area, specifically Wegman's and Stop & Shop, are letting anyone in."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/16/20,"Big shout out to TJ's staff for their continued pleasant, friendly and upbeat services. Have to say, their music selections are totally awesome -  which contributes to the positive energy in the store. It is especially gratifying to shop there through these days of COVID19. It's stressful going out these days. However, I actually look forward to marketing at TJ's."
Sarah O.,"Boston, MA",5,8/22/20,"""This place is like a candy store with a few essentials.""- literally just overheard someone in the checkout line say thisI'm always so impressed at how friendly and ready to help TJ's associates are. Never had a bad experience.Prices are always unexpectedly lower than you would expect for such high quality, delicious food. Whether to buy flowers is a question when I go to the grocery store because, although they're pretty and cheery, they're pricey. Not at TJ's though. Today I bought Gerber daisies to add a pop of color and brightness and it didn't break the bank.Today I was impressed that at the door there is an associate spraying everyone's hands with hand sanitizer before they enter. What a great idea!"
Emily L.,"Boston, MA",5,12/4/19,"So many great items at trader joes! Loved their shrimp cake but they stopped making it. Always on the look out for other delicious items like their yuzu soda. Kids can look for stuffed animals and get a small prize if they tell one of their staff where it is. Also, can request a kiddie size shopping cart to make it a more fun experience for them."
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",4,3/5/20,"Trader Joe's is always great for all basic snacks, and the best of taste typically in bakery and meats. This location, like all others, didn't disappoint. While it would be nice to have a larger parking lot that isn't full to the brim and is consistently jammed, I guess it should be lucky to have one at all being that this is Cambridge. Selection was very plentiful. The store was super busy and even on a busy Sunday afternoon many people were filling the shelves. Everything I wanted was in stock, and even though some of the other Trader Joe's locations I visit are less busy, some seem to be more frequently out of stock of certain items.The meats here looked fresh and the staff were friendly. Plenty of checkout lanes open on a Sunday. Good store. Would highly suggest, always a benefit if you can come here on off hours though as parking is a struggle. 4 stars."
Paul Z.,"Belmont, MA",5,11/21/19,Great TJs. I go there after work during the week and it's rarely crowded. They are always well stocked and the staff if always friendly and seemingly happy. Parking lot can be a bit of a cluster at times but I've been to TJs in other cities where you have to wait in line to park so whatever.
Nic C.,"Arlington, MA",4,11/1/19,Love this Trader Joe's! I am always coming in here for fresh produce and frozen food. The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when they're busy. The sample area is always welcoming even when I would prefer not to sample lol. Other tj's seem like they don't want to give you samples but not this one! The parking lot is a total shit show I have been backed into multiple times (side note if 2 cars back up into each other no one is at fault pet insurance) and due to the location homeless people tend to hang around and set up shop around the Dunks but this is still my fav Trader Joe's. I recommend going in off peak hours!
Ros S.,"Belmont, MA",1,10/8/19,"I took my auntie to grocery shopping today to my TJ , it was  and  at the same time.A young women Sara wasn't helpful to us at all, I am so disappointed, all the top service that I had received over the years in this location is gone. I understand bad days but this was plain rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.Shocking to see this behavior in such a wonderful store. 10 for the store 0 for her service."
Valeria S.,"Somerville, MA",5,7/9/18,"Love going to this Trader Joe's. It's larger than than the one in Boston or in Cambridge. Sometimes there can be a bit of people specially during the weekends but nothing too crazy. I've never had to wait long to check out.I love the little samples they always have, some have been so good I've bought the actual item. The coffee is also a nice little touch to have while shopping. Aside from the service the staff is super friendly and really helpful!"
W. A.,"Cambridge, MA",2,1/27/18,mass.gov/service-details…This store does not post the legal signs for price accuracy. Once again they scanned an item higher than the posted price. They corrected the price when I pointed it out at checkout. They did not offer or provide one item free which the law requires. Why doesn't this store comply with the law?
Court S.,"Oakland, CA",4,10/17/14,"In my last review I complained about the awful parking spots. I need to write an update to inform folks reading this that I've been humbled. I recently moved to FL and the closet TJ's is 40mi away. Yes the closest. Smh. I absolutely love this store and all it's products and employees. Every time I visit and every store I shop in has very nice employees. Now that it's pumpkin season there are so many deliciously seasoned pumpkin themed items. I'm super stoked! My faves are the pumpkin waffles, spiced granola and pumpkin ice cream. I'm also a fan of the Trader Joe's app because it highlights featured items and gives recipe suggestions. Ahhh how I love this store!"
Nicholas H.,"Montreal, Canada",5,3/28/18,"I want to give a huge shout out to Matt, Claire, and Trader Joe's in General. My wife and I frequently shop at the Trader Joe's Alewife location in Cambridge, MA. Today I called the location wondering if they do flower delivery as my wife works across the street. Today is our two year anniversary. Matt not only offered to make an exception and do a delivery which they do not normally do, but would not take my money for payment! He said that it was ""for love"" and that they're just happy to have us as customers. Naturally, my wife was blown away and thrilled with the flowers! Thank you so much to everyone that made this happen! You've made lifelong customers out of us with service that goes leaps and bounds above the norm! Sincerely, a loyal customer! :)"
Jordan M.,"Cambridge, MA",5,6/1/17,"Extremely good products for very good prices. My wife and I had no idea how awesome Trader Joe's was until we moved to Cambridge. A lot of their products are way cheaper than similar alternatives elsewhere. I was particularly surprised by the ground beef. The store is always well stocked, well staffed and very clean. Everyone is very friendly and look like they enjoy their jobs and they always ensure you have had a good experience. Would recommend this place to everyone. It's definitely a way cheaper alternative to Whole Foods."
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",5,11/2/18,I just realized that Trader Joe's are the same across the US! I noticed the East Coast stores house the produce away from the front doors a tad. Shopping today took me just a few minutes... same as back home. Ahhhh national chains;))
Amy X.,"Boston, MA",5,2/2/16,"This will be your go to place if you are any of the following: - Want fresh produce similar to Whole Foods Quality but way cheaper;- Food that appears and tastes better than Star Market/Market Basket;- A self proclaimed (or wannabee) snack junkie.I mean seriously, for the price, selection, and service, (not to mention the free sampling), I can't think of a better grocery. Not comparing this to any specialty stores."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9/15/14,"I, too, am surprised by the negative reviews of the employees here. I've been frequenting this TJs since it opened and my interaction as well as observations of the employees have been nothing short of wonderful (with the exception of one: the tall guy named Dave. He's rude to everyone and I would rather wait in line that has 10 people with carts full of groceries than go to his register and deal with his rudeness).The store is always in order and well stocked and if there's something you're looking for but can't find they go out of the way to look around the shelves (sometimes they reorganize and put it somewhere else) or check the back to see if it's about to be restocked. The prices are super reasonable and they have a lot of unique items. If you're interested in a product but not sure if you'd like it, you can take it to the demo station and they'll open it and give you a sample.Ignore the negative reviews bcz they're probably about the tall pale guy Dave. There will always be one bad apple in a bunch, toss it aside, pretend it doesn't exist, and feast your eyes upon the glorious bunch. Everyone there is a delight and sometimes go out of their way to make you smile."
Heather O.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/10/14,"I do not understand the negative reviews about the staff here. The staff at this TJs goes above and beyond!Once I asked the worker if the peanut butter and jelly chocolate was good. He said ""I dont know, here lets split one and try it, on me"" (it was in fact delicious)Another time I sighed out loud so the worker was asking what was up. I mentioned I was moving and changing my job all in the same week and the stress was taking a toll on me. As I was cashing out she disappeared and brought me a sunflower as a present. It made my day! SO nice of her.I always have great experiences here and find the staff exceptionally nice and helpful. This is the best TJs ever!"
Beth N.,"Medford, MA",1,8/20/17,"Geez. Please tell me why grocery stores like the trader joes chain stores are one of the worst environments to do your grocery shopping. I am just looking for a local trader joe near where I live to get a few good value buys. You know.I am looking for a pleasant environment, cashiers that do a decent job,and no over kill. Meaning, the people in the store do not criticize other persons in public,Ie: try to humiliate them for whatever reason.Does any such store exist here in the state of Mass. ? Where they exhibit good behavior ?Yeah. Today was really a lousy experience for me . But it was lousy last weekas well. Two times, two lousy experiences at the same location. I just needed to pick up a few things, you know, the things that I like to stock in my shelves.Hmm. Why were these people soooo rude, I wonder.In my experience, I would need to ask these people, why are you here?As to the role and responsibilty of the workers, one would think, perhaps,to promote a decent shopping trip, or experience for all.That would mean, Fairness, Equality, Non judgemental behavior, behavior that is non critical, Unbiased, and Non prejudiced.Ehem. I can repeat those words. As that goes for the People, ie : public shoppers in there. As well. All the while,This was during ""the big free speech rally on the Boston common.""As we are talking about Behavioral problems .And the lacking therein, of any sign of human decent Behavior. Towards others. Anti-social behavior, Rudeness, Abhorent snobbery. Unkindness. Makes me want to Puke in their faces.These people are just every day people. Not protestors, orfree speech groups, not groups of that sort. Just everyday shoppers.Hmm. Such a waste. Of a human being's time to have to spend any time at allin their company. In the company of such Rude twarts.This is not the store's fault. These are just some of the other customers.A sampling. As Then, we could look at the actual Cashier Job. What is the job of a grocery clerk/ cashier ? Ie: Check people out  at the register ?So, let me go on. There are customers Then there are employees.The function of a grocery store check out is not all that difficult to grasp.Cash handling. So, in the case of any of a person beingSo rude, and So obnoxious ? Especially if it happens to be in the case if the employee?Not working. Should b fired. They are not working, and need to be sent home.The customer doesnt need to do anything except take care of herself .The customer doesnt need to help anyone. Except themself.The employee who acts out, is rude and disrespectful ought to be firedfor not doing their job. Plain and simple.Are they in fact the reason why their customersAre so rude ? Are they acting just like these rude customers, in fact ?Or is it part of the training ?What is really going on. ?Just what do they think they can do here  ?Do they really need to expect me to do anything for themExcept mind my own business, get what I need and get the Hell out of that hellhole crap sham shak ? Is rudeness included in the job description.?Any sign of that, rudeness, etc., either on the register, or just being around, shows that someone is not really doing their job.And not doing a good job is the same as not working period.There is no place for such displays of dysfunctionality when there is a job that people, the customers, needs and depends upon.Other than that, maybe I need to ask them, is ""ringing a cow bell"" in a personsEardrums again, part of the Sham ? I find that to be cruel and Abusive Torture.As to their products. 1. Do you really want to Overkill our bodies with Junk food,High sugar, and salt overload and other generic crap food ? That being said, 2. Do you have a problem with allowing people to read labels, aand shop for what they need at their own pace , which is expected when youare paying for something and buying something that would be for your own diet needs??- --is that labeled as""crazy""; --by the people who work thereAnd promote this kind of attitude of gang warfare within ? Or are they aimed on focusing and targeting a person whom theyassume would have money and bs them into buying crap to make Them happy.?And help out with sales ???Also is this part of that same training stragegy ?Rather than that of providing  customers with a pleasant  shopping experience ???--Sorry.

Plenty of checkout lanes open on a Sunday. Good store. Would highly suggest, always a benefit if you can come here on off hours though as parking is a struggle. 4 stars."
Paul Z.,"Belmont, MA",5,11/21/19,Great TJs. I go there after work during the week and it's rarely crowded. They are always well stocked and the staff if always friendly and seemingly happy. Parking lot can be a bit of a cluster at times but I've been to TJs in other cities where you have to wait in line to park so whatever.
Nic C.,"Arlington, MA",4,11/1/19,Love this Trader Joe's! I am always coming in here for fresh produce and frozen food. The staff is always very friendly and helpful even when they're busy. The sample area is always welcoming even when I would prefer not to sample lol. Other tj's seem like they don't want to give you samples but not this one! The parking lot is a total shit show I have been backed into multiple times (side note if 2 cars back up into each other no one is at fault pet insurance) and due to the location homeless people tend to hang around and set up shop around the Dunks but this is still my fav Trader Joe's. I recommend going in off peak hours!
Ros S.,"Belmont, MA",1,10/8/19,"I took my auntie to grocery shopping today to my TJ , it was  and  at the same time.A young women Sara wasn't helpful to us at all, I am so disappointed, all the top service that I had received over the years in this location is gone. I understand bad days but this was plain rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.Shocking to see this behavior in such a wonderful store. 10 for the store 0 for her service."
Valeria S.,"Somerville, MA",5,7/9/18,"Love going to this Trader Joe's. It's larger than than the one in Boston or in Cambridge. Sometimes there can be a bit of people specially during the weekends but nothing too crazy. I've never had to wait long to check out.I love the little samples they always have, some have been so good I've bought the actual item. The coffee is also a nice little touch to have while shopping. Aside from the service the staff is super friendly and really helpful!"
W. A.,"Cambridge, MA",2,1/27/18,mass.gov/service-details…This store does not post the legal signs for price accuracy. Once again they scanned an item higher than the posted price. They corrected the price when I pointed it out at checkout. They did not offer or provide one item free which the law requires. Why doesn't this store comply with the law?
Court S.,"Oakland, CA",4,10/17/14,"In my last review I complained about the awful parking spots. I need to write an update to inform folks reading this that I've been humbled. I recently moved to FL and the closet TJ's is 40mi away. Yes the closest. Smh. I absolutely love this store and all it's products and employees. Every time I visit and every store I shop in has very nice employees. Now that it's pumpkin season there are so many deliciously seasoned pumpkin themed items. I'm super stoked! My faves are the pumpkin waffles, spiced granola and pumpkin ice cream. I'm also a fan of the Trader Joe's app because it highlights featured items and gives recipe suggestions. Ahhh how I love this store!"
Nicholas H.,"Montreal, Canada",5,3/28/18,"I want to give a huge shout out to Matt, Claire, and Trader Joe's in General. My wife and I frequently shop at the Trader Joe's Alewife location in Cambridge, MA. Today I called the location wondering if they do flower delivery as my wife works across the street. Today is our two year anniversary. Matt not only offered to make an exception and do a delivery which they do not normally do, but would not take my money for payment! He said that it was ""for love"" and that they're just happy to have us as customers. Naturally, my wife was blown away and thrilled with the flowers! Thank you so much to everyone that made this happen! You've made lifelong customers out of us with service that goes leaps and bounds above the norm! Sincerely, a loyal customer! :)"
Jordan M.,"Cambridge, MA",5,6/1/17,"Extremely good products for very good prices. My wife and I had no idea how awesome Trader Joe's was until we moved to Cambridge. A lot of their products are way cheaper than similar alternatives elsewhere. I was particularly surprised by the ground beef. The store is always well stocked, well staffed and very clean. Everyone is very friendly and look like they enjoy their jobs and they always ensure you have had a good experience. Would recommend this place to everyone. It's definitely a way cheaper alternative to Whole Foods."
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",5,11/2/18,I just realized that Trader Joe's are the same across the US! I noticed the East Coast stores house the produce away from the front doors a tad. Shopping today took me just a few minutes... same as back home. Ahhhh national chains;))
Amy X.,"Boston, MA",5,2/2/16,"This will be your go to place if you are any of the following: - Want fresh produce similar to Whole Foods Quality but way cheaper;- Food that appears and tastes better than Star Market/Market Basket;- A self proclaimed (or wannabee) snack junkie.I mean seriously, for the price, selection, and service, (not to mention the free sampling), I can't think of a better grocery. Not comparing this to any specialty stores."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9/15/14,"I, too, am surprised by the negative reviews of the employees here. I've been frequenting this TJs since it opened and my interaction as well as observations of the employees have been nothing short of wonderful (with the exception of one: the tall guy named Dave. He's rude to everyone and I would rather wait in line that has 10 people with carts full of groceries than go to his register and deal with his rudeness).The store is always in order and well stocked and if there's something you're looking for but can't find they go out of the way to look around the shelves (sometimes they reorganize and put it somewhere else) or check the back to see if it's about to be restocked. The prices are super reasonable and they have a lot of unique items. If you're interested in a product but not sure if you'd like it, you can take it to the demo station and they'll open it and give you a sample.Ignore the negative reviews bcz they're probably about the tall pale guy Dave. There will always be one bad apple in a bunch, toss it aside, pretend it doesn't exist, and feast your eyes upon the glorious bunch. Everyone there is a delight and sometimes go out of their way to make you smile."
Heather O.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/10/14,"I do not understand the negative reviews about the staff here. The staff at this TJs goes above and beyond!Once I asked the worker if the peanut butter and jelly chocolate was good. He said ""I dont know, here lets split one and try it, on me"" (it was in fact delicious)Another time I sighed out loud so the worker was asking what was up. I mentioned I was moving and changing my job all in the same week and the stress was taking a toll on me. As I was cashing out she disappeared and brought me a sunflower as a present. It made my day! SO nice of her.I always have great experiences here and find the staff exceptionally nice and helpful. This is the best TJs ever!"
Beth N.,"Medford, MA",1,8/20/17,"Geez. Please tell me why grocery stores like the trader joes chain stores are one of the worst environments to do your grocery shopping. I am just looking for a local trader joe near where I live to get a few good value buys. You know.I am looking for a pleasant environment, cashiers that do a decent job,and no over kill. Meaning, the people in the store do not criticize other persons in public,Ie: try to humiliate them for whatever reason.Does any such store exist here in the state of Mass. ? Where they exhibit good behavior ?Yeah. Today was really a lousy experience for me . But it was lousy last weekas well. Two times, two lousy experiences at the same location. I just needed to pick up a few things, you know, the things that I like to stock in my shelves.Hmm. Why were these people soooo rude, I wonder.In my experience, I would need to ask these people, why are you here?As to the role and responsibilty of the workers, one would think, perhaps,to promote a decent shopping trip, or experience for all.That would mean, Fairness, Equality, Non judgemental behavior, behavior that is non critical, Unbiased, and Non prejudiced.Ehem. I can repeat those words. As that goes for the People, ie : public shoppers in there. As well. All the while,This was during ""the big free speech rally on the Boston common.""As we are talking about Behavioral problems .And the lacking therein, of any sign of human decent Behavior. Towards others. Anti-social behavior, Rudeness, Abhorent snobbery. Unkindness. Makes me want to Puke in their faces.These people are just every day people. Not protestors, orfree speech groups, not groups of that sort. Just everyday shoppers.Hmm. Such a waste. Of a human being's time to have to spend any time at allin their company. In the company of such Rude twarts.This is not the store's fault. These are just some of the other customers.A sampling. As Then, we could look at the actual Cashier Job. What is the job of a grocery clerk/ cashier ? Ie: Check people out  at the register ?So, let me go on. There are customers Then there are employees.The function of a grocery store check out is not all that difficult to grasp.Cash handling. So, in the case of any of a person beingSo rude, and So obnoxious ? Especially if it happens to be in the case if the employee?Not working. Should b fired. They are not working, and need to be sent home.The customer doesnt need to do anything except take care of herself .The customer doesnt need to help anyone. Except themself.The employee who acts out, is rude and disrespectful ought to be firedfor not doing their job. Plain and simple.Are they in fact the reason why their customersAre so rude ? Are they acting just like these rude customers, in fact ?Or is it part of the training ?What is really going on. ?Just what do they think they can do here  ?Do they really need to expect me to do anything for themExcept mind my own business, get what I need and get the Hell out of that hellhole crap sham shak ? Is rudeness included in the job description.?Any sign of that, rudeness, etc., either on the register, or just being around, shows that someone is not really doing their job.And not doing a good job is the same as not working period.There is no place for such displays of dysfunctionality when there is a job that people, the customers, needs and depends upon.Other than that, maybe I need to ask them, is ""ringing a cow bell"" in a personsEardrums again, part of the Sham ? I find that to be cruel and Abusive Torture.As to their products. 1. Do you really want to Overkill our bodies with Junk food,High sugar, and salt overload and other generic crap food ? That being said, 2. Do you have a problem with allowing people to read labels, aand shop for what they need at their own pace , which is expected when youare paying for something and buying something that would be for your own diet needs??- --is that labeled as""crazy""; --by the people who work thereAnd promote this kind of attitude of gang warfare within ? Or are they aimed on focusing and targeting a person whom theyassume would have money and bs them into buying crap to make Them happy.?And help out with sales ???Also is this part of that same training stragegy ?Rather than that of providing  customers with a pleasant  shopping experience ???--Sorry. I did not realize if that is what it was.A sham. So sorry."
Alan T.,"Wayland, MA",5,12/31/17,Big fan. The quality and prices are great. Good tasty food. I go to the one in Fresh Pond area. Open till 10pm - works for me!
A R.,"Cambridge, MA",5,8/12/17,"Great quality items for a modest price.  Excellent chocolate, olive oil, cheese, almond milk, fruit, veg.  Produce more limited than some groceries, but enough choice for me.  Usually have organic oprions available.  Plus, I've discovered things I would not have thought yo look for if they didn't have it.Staff is the best! -- well trained, very friendly, efficient.  I've never seen grocery store staff so friendly and cheerful anywhere else."
Patricia H.,"Medford, MA",5,3/29/20,"As always, Trader Joe's has good products, reasonable prices, nice staff. Extra kudos for having senior hours during the pandemic & actually enforcing them. Other stores in the area, specifically Wegman's and Stop & Shop, are letting anyone in."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/16/20,"Big shout out to TJ's staff for their continued pleasant, friendly and upbeat services. Have to say, their music selections are totally awesome -  which contributes to the positive energy in the store. It is especially gratifying to shop there through these days of COVID19. It's stressful going out these days. However, I actually look forward to marketing at TJ's."
Sarah O.,"Boston, MA",5,8/22/20,"""This place is like a candy store with a few essentials.""- literally just overheard someone in the checkout line say thisI'm always so impressed at how friendly and ready to help TJ's associates are. Never had a bad experience.Prices are always unexpectedly lower than you would expect for such high quality, delicious food. Whether to buy flowers is a question when I go to the grocery store because, although they're pretty and cheery, they're pricey. Not at TJ's though. Today I bought Gerber daisies to add a pop of color and brightness and it didn't break the bank.Today I was impressed that at the door there is an associate spraying everyone's hands with hand sanitizer before they enter. What a great idea!"
Emily L.,"Boston, MA",5,12/4/19,"So many great items at trader joes! Loved their shrimp cake but they stopped making it. Always on the look out for other delicious items like their yuzu soda. Kids can look for stuffed animals and get a small prize if they tell one of their staff where it is. Also, can request a kiddie size shopping cart to make it a more fun experience for them."
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",4,3/5/20,"Trader Joe's is always great for all basic snacks, and the best of taste typically in bakery and meats. This location, like all others, didn't disappoint. While it would be nice to have a larger parking lot that isn't full to the brim and is consistently jammed, I guess it should be lucky to have one at all being that this is Cambridge. Selection was very plentiful. The store was super busy and even on a busy Sunday afternoon many people were filling the shelves.

Every time I visit and every store I shop in has very nice employees. Now that it's pumpkin season there are so many deliciously seasoned pumpkin themed items. I'm super stoked! My faves are the pumpkin waffles, spiced granola and pumpkin ice cream. I'm also a fan of the Trader Joe's app because it highlights featured items and gives recipe suggestions. Ahhh how I love this store!"
Nicholas H.,"Montreal, Canada",5,3/28/18,"I want to give a huge shout out to Matt, Claire, and Trader Joe's in General. My wife and I frequently shop at the Trader Joe's Alewife location in Cambridge, MA. Today I called the location wondering if they do flower delivery as my wife works across the street. Today is our two year anniversary. Matt not only offered to make an exception and do a delivery which they do not normally do, but would not take my money for payment! He said that it was ""for love"" and that they're just happy to have us as customers. Naturally, my wife was blown away and thrilled with the flowers! Thank you so much to everyone that made this happen! You've made lifelong customers out of us with service that goes leaps and bounds above the norm! Sincerely, a loyal customer! :)"
Jordan M.,"Cambridge, MA",5,6/1/17,"Extremely good products for very good prices. My wife and I had no idea how awesome Trader Joe's was until we moved to Cambridge. A lot of their products are way cheaper than similar alternatives elsewhere. I was particularly surprised by the ground beef. The store is always well stocked, well staffed and very clean. Everyone is very friendly and look like they enjoy their jobs and they always ensure you have had a good experience. Would recommend this place to everyone. It's definitely a way cheaper alternative to Whole Foods."
Nooneh K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",5,11/2/18,I just realized that Trader Joe's are the same across the US! I noticed the East Coast stores house the produce away from the front doors a tad. Shopping today took me just a few minutes... same as back home. Ahhhh national chains;))
Amy X.,"Boston, MA",5,2/2/16,"This will be your go to place if you are any of the following: - Want fresh produce similar to Whole Foods Quality but way cheaper;- Food that appears and tastes better than Star Market/Market Basket;- A self proclaimed (or wannabee) snack junkie.I mean seriously, for the price, selection, and service, (not to mention the free sampling), I can't think of a better grocery. Not comparing this to any specialty stores."
Lee E.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9/15/14,"I, too, am surprised by the negative reviews of the employees here. I've been frequenting this TJs since it opened and my interaction as well as observations of the employees have been nothing short of wonderful (with the exception of one: the tall guy named Dave. He's rude to everyone and I would rather wait in line that has 10 people with carts full of groceries than go to his register and deal with his rudeness).The store is always in order and well stocked and if there's something you're looking for but can't find they go out of the way to look around the shelves (sometimes they reorganize and put it somewhere else) or check the back to see if it's about to be restocked. The prices are super reasonable and they have a lot of unique items. If you're interested in a product but not sure if you'd like it, you can take it to the demo station and they'll open it and give you a sample.Ignore the negative reviews bcz they're probably about the tall pale guy Dave. There will always be one bad apple in a bunch, toss it aside, pretend it doesn't exist, and feast your eyes upon the glorious bunch. Everyone there is a delight and sometimes go out of their way to make you smile."
Heather O.,"Beverly, MA",5,9/10/14,"I do not understand the negative reviews about the staff here. The staff at this TJs goes above and beyond!Once I asked the worker if the peanut butter and jelly chocolate was good. He said ""I dont know, here lets split one and try it, on me"" (it was in fact delicious)Another time I sighed out loud so the worker was asking what was up. I mentioned I was moving and changing my job all in the same week and the stress was taking a toll on me. As I was cashing out she disappeared and brought me a sunflower as a present. It made my day! SO nice of her.I always have great experiences here and find the staff exceptionally nice and helpful. This is the best TJs ever!"
Beth N.,"Medford, MA",1,8/20/17,"Geez. Please tell me why grocery stores like the trader joes chain stores are one of the worst environments to do your grocery shopping. I am just looking for a local trader joe near where I live to get a few good value buys. You know.I am looking for a pleasant environment, cashiers that do a decent job,and no over kill. Meaning, the people in the store do not criticize other persons in public,Ie: try to humiliate them for whatever reason.Does any such store exist here in the state of Mass. ? Where they exhibit good behavior ?Yeah. Today was really a lousy experience for me . But it was lousy last weekas well. Two times, two lousy experiences at the same location. I just needed to pick up a few things, you know, the things that I like to stock in my shelves.Hmm. Why were these people soooo rude, I wonder.In my experience, I would need to ask these people, why are you here?As to the role and responsibilty of the workers, one would think, perhaps,to promote a decent shopping trip, or experience for all.That would mean, Fairness, Equality, Non judgemental behavior, behavior that is non critical, Unbiased, and Non prejudiced.Ehem. I can repeat those words. As that goes for the People, ie : public shoppers in there. As well. All the while,This was during ""the big free speech rally on the Boston common.""As we are talking about Behavioral problems .And the lacking therein, of any sign of human decent Behavior. Towards others. Anti-social behavior, Rudeness, Abhorent snobbery. Unkindness. Makes me want to Puke in their faces.These people are just every day people. Not protestors, orfree speech groups, not groups of that sort. Just everyday shoppers.Hmm. Such a waste. Of a human being's time to have to spend any time at allin their company. In the company of such Rude twarts.This is not the store's fault. These are just some of the other customers.A sampling. As Then, we could look at the actual Cashier Job. What is the job of a grocery clerk/ cashier ? Ie: Check people out  at the register ?So, let me go on. There are customers Then there are employees.The function of a grocery store check out is not all that difficult to grasp.Cash handling. So, in the case of any of a person beingSo rude, and So obnoxious ? Especially if it happens to be in the case if the employee?Not working. Should b fired. They are not working, and need to be sent home.The customer doesnt need to do anything except take care of herself .The customer doesnt need to help anyone. Except themself.The employee who acts out, is rude and disrespectful ought to be firedfor not doing their job. Plain and simple.Are they in fact the reason why their customersAre so rude ? Are they acting just like these rude customers, in fact ?Or is it part of the training ?What is really going on. ?Just what do they think they can do here  ?Do they really need to expect me to do anything for themExcept mind my own business, get what I need and get the Hell out of that hellhole crap sham shak ? Is rudeness included in the job description.?Any sign of that, rudeness, etc., either on the register, or just being around, shows that someone is not really doing their job.And not doing a good job is the same as not working period.There is no place for such displays of dysfunctionality when there is a job that people, the customers, needs and depends upon.Other than that, maybe I need to ask them, is ""ringing a cow bell"" in a personsEardrums again, part of the Sham ? I find that to be cruel and Abusive Torture.As to their products. 1. Do you really want to Overkill our bodies with Junk food,High sugar, and salt overload and other generic crap food ? That being said, 2. Do you have a problem with allowing people to read labels, aand shop for what they need at their own pace , which is expected when youare paying for something and buying something that would be for your own diet needs??- --is that labeled as""crazy""; --by the people who work thereAnd promote this kind of attitude of gang warfare within ? Or are they aimed on focusing and targeting a person whom theyassume would have money and bs them into buying crap to make Them happy.?And help out with sales ???Also is this part of that same training stragegy ?Rather than that of providing  customers with a pleasant  shopping experience ???--Sorry. I did not realize if that is what it was.A sham. So sorry."
Alan T.,"Wayland, MA",5,12/31/17,Big fan. The quality and prices are great. Good tasty food. I go to the one in Fresh Pond area. Open till 10pm - works for me!
A R.,"Cambridge, MA",5,8/12/17,"Great quality items for a modest price.  Excellent chocolate, olive oil, cheese, almond milk, fruit, veg.  Produce more limited than some groceries, but enough choice for me.  Usually have organic oprions available.  Plus, I've discovered things I would not have thought yo look for if they didn't have it.Staff is the best! -- well trained, very friendly, efficient.  I've never seen grocery store staff so friendly and cheerful anywhere else."
Margot D.,"Boston, MA",5,8/8/19,"Today started out badly, and my carefully planned to-do list was blown by 7am; I wandered into TJ's since I needed the CVS next door, so after parking on Highland Ave (do yourself a favor, put a quarter in the meter and avoid the TJ's/CVS parking lot) I strolled through the store.After searching various locations for over a year and unable to find the dried apple rings, there they were on the shelf; suddenly, my day was getting better.  Next up were the nice looking strawberries and the grand finale was Adam at the register:  TJ's usually hires cool/nice people, and Adam was awesome."
Raenelle F.,"Boston, MA",1,9/11/20,"Honestly if I can give this location less then a star I would. Their customer service skills toward Black People are horrible. Today I visited the Hingham location for the first time normally I go to Brookline to shop. But we figured we will try this location. Upon arriving all was well. But half way through the store I felt like I had eyes on me. ""you know that feel when some one is close to you"" that's exactly what I felt. As we walked through the isles my son and niece who are both 5 found themselves acting as children do, along with another child In the aisle. When I realized my two children were rowdy I spoke to them. In the midst of me speaking to them a one of your employees(short, 50s, blondish hair) decided to say something to MY children. This is during I'm speaking to them. I nicely said to her Mam we understand, as you can hear I am speaking to them about the calming down and not playing in the store. Her words to me were""I know but I figured I should let you know"" meaning she knew exactly what was going on. Also must I mention she said nothing to the other child throwing herself on the ground.  As we continued to walk through another gentlemen started to pretend he was doing inventory. Normally there will me any quarrels about this but he literally followed us to another aisle and pretended to do the same thing. One knows inventory in one aisle doesn't go this quickly. As we walked the same woman who spoke to me the first time wound up behind us, and everywhere we turned. She even proceeded to the register as we were walking to it. It's as if she was along for the shopping trip literally. As we stood in line she blatantly started speaking to her co worker about us and looking at us. As I stood there in the manner to let her know I see what she is doing it was only then she turned her back as her she continued to talk about us and her co worker looked at us.  You may have guessed by now I am a black woman. The funnier point of this story is that we were the only black people in the store at this point. I mean this from workers to patrons. For this store and their workers to single us out, ESPECIALLY at the time we are at in this world is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. Never have I gone to Brookline and felt this way, NEVER ! I really left that store in tears and humiliated by the manner in which they treated us. I am a law abiding tax paying black woman. Not only do they not know my background not my family but they have no right to treat us in that manner.  Idk if Hingham has a separate rule on how they treat black people, it's ridiculous. I spend the same money and work just as hard as any of the other customers.  Let's Fix this problem!"
Bob G.,"Needham, MA",2,8/30/20,"Very friendly staff, but their supply chain is mismanaged. Constantly out of something. Every time I go there something on my list is out of stock. My solution? After three strikes, I never look again and use Amazon Prime. Also, no alcohol. They kow tow to New England Puritanism."
Dorit S.,"Waltham, MA",4,4/9/19,"Honestly this Trader Joe's is probably the best in the area. It's a little further away from my place but totally worth the trip. My local Joe's is the one in newton which is about a quarter of the size of this one. The parking lot at this location can be a pain at busier times so that's why I didn't give a full 5/5 but I'm a regular for sure! In general I love getting my groceries here,simply, because of the unique selection of products and the many healthy options. It's also far more affordable than Whole Foods. My favorite part... they have a couple of  spices that were ""made in South Africa"" (my home) which always puts a smile on my face!"
Hanna G.,"Boston, MA",3,11/30/18,"I'm torn, just like the sad pie crusts we purchased. On the one hand this place introduced me to delicious Cara Cara pink oranges and very strange Plumcots/Apriplums (these are not the same thing folks haha). However, as Matt H. mentioned this place is frequently out of many basics. All of the employees here are also super friendly and I love trying their samples of the day. This location is very small so they have limited inventory they can carry unfortunately.Not even sure what I was thinking the week of Thanksgiving expecting to find some last minute items for an apple pie. We first attempted to find a basic apple pie to avoid the DIY baking. No luck, only fruit tarts available. So we hunted down ingredients for making the pie ourselves. We flagged down an employee to find some flour, brown sugar, pie crusts and marinade. Many of the shelves were completely bare! They were in the process of unloading a shipment that just arrived. We only ended up purchasing a set of 2 pie crusts and marinade (not for baking pie). We had to stop by Star Market instead another day. So we will just use TJs to supplement our regular grocery trip visits.Now back to those sad pie crusts... It nearly caused a disaster day of Thanksgiving when we attempted to roll it out. BOTH OF THEM BROKE! Thankfully the in laws were prepared with extra crusts on hand to finish off the pie. We have no idea what to do these defective crusts now."
Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",5,3/26/16,"I can't say enough about the wonderful wines at trader Joe's, I have found superb wines across the spectrum: reds, whites, roses etc. at very affordable prices. TJ's makes deals around the world with named vineyards and producers to private label undersold or residual vintages as well as partners with small local vintners to bring it's customers very good quality wines at considerably less expense. I have found the people in the wine department to be very helpful, knowledgeable and have frequently ask their opinions on new wines to try which almost always ends in finding another new delightful wine."

Samantha G.,"Norwood, MA",1,9/15/18,Not sure if I went on an off night but at 7 pm on a Saturday they had very little stocked. The meat/cheese/produce/most refrigerator stuff was very slim pickings. The store is tiny and honestly a giant disappointment. I'll go to Foxboro next time.
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",5,8/29/15,"One of the three grocery spots in Needham.

Milia M.,"Boston, MA",5,12/12/13,The Best Customer Service in the area. Wonderful Manager and lovely workers. As good as it gets. One time we had a problem with a bread went bad too quickly and manager quickly offered to give us new loaf free of charge. TJ really stands out with the quality service and kind employees! Thank you Trader Joe!
Debbie R.,"Boston, MA",5,1/24/18,"This is a large store. The aisles are wide. The displays are sparking clean. The fruit man offered to help me select.

Jim S.,"Needham, MA",4,10/31/16,great grocery store but they DO NOT sell wine beer or spirits. Trader Joe's is a great alternative to the more expensive supermarkets in the area even though they don't sell wine.
Milia M.,"Boston, MA",5,12/12/13,The Best Customer Service in the area. Wonderful Manager and lovely workers. As good as it gets. One time we had a problem with a bread went bad too quickly and manager quickly offered to give us new loaf free of charge. TJ really stands out with the quality service and kind employees! Thank you Trader Joe!
Debbie R.,"Boston, MA",5,1/24/18,"This is a large store. The aisles are wide. The displays are sparking clean. The fruit man offered to help me select. The check-out man offered to start running my first cart through, while I completed my selections in a second cart. Two workers pushed my carts to the car, and loaded my bags in."
erica c.,"Boston, MA",5,12/30/06,"Like Merrill, this was also my first trader joe's experience ever.....so it holds a special place in MY heart!I have never been to a trader's joe's that I didn't like but this one seems especially fabulous....less crowded and the staff is super friendly and helpful....The frozen whip-up-in-no-time-but still-be-healthy meals are one of my faves here.....fast food doesn't always have to be dripping in trans fats!!!!"
Kris G.,"West Roxbury, MA",5,11/19/14,I live much closer to the Trader Joe's located in Brookline but I prefer to travel to this location. It offers a much better parking situation and usually has everything I need in stock. The staff is super friendly! This is my favorite place to shop for groceries.
Vara S.,"Needham, MA",1,12/5/15,denise d is an ignorant fake psychoshe threw my change on the floor and purposefully gave me a ripped bag
C. F.,"Concord, MA",4,1/14/15,TJ's!My fave place to stock up on frozen lunches for the week. For about $35 I can get a great selection of stuff for throwing in the microwave (plus some snacks) for lunch all week long
Margot D.,"Boston, MA",5,8/8/19,"Today started out badly, and my carefully planned to-do list was blown by 7am; I wandered into TJ's since I needed the CVS next door, so after parking on Highland Ave (do yourself a favor, put a quarter in the meter and avoid the TJ's/CVS parking lot) I strolled through the store.After searching various locations for over a year and unable to find the dried apple rings, there they were on the shelf; suddenly, my day was getting better.  Next up were the nice looking strawberries and the grand finale was Adam at the register:  TJ's usually hires cool/nice people, and Adam was awesome."
Raenelle F.,"Boston, MA",1,9/11/20,"Honestly if I can give this location less then a star I would. Their customer service skills toward Black People are horrible. Today I visited the Hingham location for the first time normally I go to Brookline to shop. But we figured we will try this location. Upon arriving all was well. But half way through the store I felt like I had eyes on me. ""you know that feel when some one is close to you"" that's exactly what I felt. As we walked through the isles my son and niece who are both 5 found themselves acting as children do, along with another child In the aisle. When I realized my two children were rowdy I spoke to them. In the midst of me speaking to them a one of your employees(short, 50s, blondish hair) decided to say something to MY children. This is during I'm speaking to them. I nicely said to her Mam we understand, as you can hear I am speaking to them about the calming down and not playing in the store. Her words to me were""I know but I figured I should let you know"" meaning she knew exactly what was going on. Also must I mention she said nothing to the other child throwing herself on the ground.  As we continued to walk through another gentlemen started to pretend he was doing inventory. Normally there will me any quarrels about this but he literally followed us to another aisle and pretended to do the same thing. One knows inventory in one aisle doesn't go this quickly. As we walked the same woman who spoke to me the first time wound up behind us, and everywhere we turned. She even proceeded to the register as we were walking to it. It's as if she was along for the shopping trip literally. As we stood in line she blatantly started speaking to her co worker about us and looking at us. As I stood there in the manner to let her know I see what she is doing it was only then she turned her back as her she continued to talk about us and her co worker looked at us.  You may have guessed by now I am a black woman. The funnier point of this story is that we were the only black people in the store at this point. I mean this from workers to patrons. For this store and their workers to single us out, ESPECIALLY at the time we are at in this world is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. Never have I gone to Brookline and felt this way, NEVER ! I really left that store in tears and humiliated by the manner in which they treated us. I am a law abiding tax paying black woman. Not only do they not know my background not my family but they have no right to treat us in that manner.  Idk if Hingham has a separate rule on how they treat black people, it's ridiculous. I spend the same money and work just as hard as any of the other customers.  Let's Fix this problem!"
Bob G.,"Needham, MA",2,8/30/20,"Very friendly staff, but their supply chain is mismanaged. Constantly out of something. Every time I go there something on my list is out of stock. My solution? After three strikes, I never look again and use Amazon Prime. Also, no alcohol. They kow tow to New England Puritanism."
Dorit S.,"Waltham, MA",4,4/9/19,"Honestly this Trader Joe's is probably the best in the area. It's a little further away from my place but totally worth the trip. My local Joe's is the one in newton which is about a quarter of the size of this one. The parking lot at this location can be a pain at busier times so that's why I didn't give a full 5/5 but I'm a regular for sure! In general I love getting my groceries here,simply, because of the unique selection of products and the many healthy options. It's also far more affordable than Whole Foods. My favorite part... they have a couple of  spices that were ""made in South Africa"" (my home) which always puts a smile on my face!"
Hanna G.,"Boston, MA",3,11/30/18,"I'm torn, just like the sad pie crusts we purchased. On the one hand this place introduced me to delicious Cara Cara pink oranges and very strange Plumcots/Apriplums (these are not the same thing folks haha). However, as Matt H. mentioned this place is frequently out of many basics. All of the employees here are also super friendly and I love trying their samples of the day. This location is very small so they have limited inventory they can carry unfortunately.Not even sure what I was thinking the week of Thanksgiving expecting to find some last minute items for an apple pie. We first attempted to find a basic apple pie to avoid the DIY baking. No luck, only fruit tarts available. So we hunted down ingredients for making the pie ourselves. We flagged down an employee to find some flour, brown sugar, pie crusts and marinade. Many of the shelves were completely bare! They were in the process of unloading a shipment that just arrived. We only ended up purchasing a set of 2 pie crusts and marinade (not for baking pie). We had to stop by Star Market instead another day. So we will just use TJs to supplement our regular grocery trip visits.Now back to those sad pie crusts... It nearly caused a disaster day of Thanksgiving when we attempted to roll it out. BOTH OF THEM BROKE! Thankfully the in laws were prepared with extra crusts on hand to finish off the pie. We have no idea what to do these defective crusts now."
Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",5,3/26/16,"I can't say enough about the wonderful wines at trader Joe's, I have found superb wines across the spectrum: reds, whites, roses etc. at very affordable prices. TJ's makes deals around the world with named vineyards and producers to private label undersold or residual vintages as well as partners with small local vintners to bring it's customers very good quality wines at considerably less expense. I have found the people in the wine department to be very helpful, knowledgeable and have frequently ask their opinions on new wines to try which almost always ends in finding another new delightful wine."
Matt H.,"Boston, MA",3,11/1/18,"I love me some TJ's but this location kind of blows. They are frequently stocked out on a lot of basics. On my last trip there I had like 5 things on my list and the only thing I could get was cilantro. No canned tomatoes, very small selection of rice. The staff is really nice and parking pretty easy. Just wish it was bigger and better."
Jennifer W.,"San Francisco, CA",4,10/3/16,"There aren't a ton of grocery stores in the area (that I know of) that aren't too far away and affordable, but Trader Joe's fits that description.Really like shopping at this Trader Joe's as it's right by a CVS, so I can do most of my shopping in that area.Inside, the people are friendly, and the store is always neat and orderly. Typically shop there for baby carrots, chips + salsa, dark chocolate covered pretzels, and the chocolate covered espresso beans.The gluten-free jojos are decent as well, though some people have told me that it doesn't taste like much and has the texture of sand (but to each their own).Pretty similar to the other Trader Joe's I've shopped at (both within and out of state).Despite the 'Wine & Spirits' tag, this Trader Joe's does NOT sell wine and spirits, so if you're looking for that, go next door."
Elana E.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",4,6/14/17,"I also live close to the Trader Joe's in Coolidge Corner....which I avoid at all costs since it is always packed.What I like here:1. supremely friendly staff--they are happy to check in the back if an item isn't on the shelf2. good quality produce3. excellent variety in the things I like, at a great price point.  I get my nuts, dried fruit, organic eggs and chocolate here and nowhere else.4. nice selection of frozen foods for those nights when all you can do is stick something in the toaster oven for 20 minutes.5. Whole milk European (pourable) plain yogurt, which I love and haven't seen in other markets.What I'd like to see:1. a 5 cent rebate for bringing your own bags2. fat-free half and half"
Margaret H.,"Norwood, MA",4,5/6/18,It is very neat and clean. The produce is always fresh. The employees are always very nice and helpful. I wish it was a little bit bigger and I wish they had alcohol like other Trader Joe's have. But overall I will be back!
Samantha G.,"Norwood, MA",1,9/15/18,Not sure if I went on an off night but at 7 pm on a Saturday they had very little stocked. The meat/cheese/produce/most refrigerator stuff was very slim pickings. The store is tiny and honestly a giant disappointment. I'll go to Foxboro next time.
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",5,8/29/15,"One of the three grocery spots in Needham. I am not the hugest fan of Roche or Sudbury due to the high prices and in the case of both of the Needham locations, the lack of space. Trader Joe's is also small, but this one is honestly the perfect size for the amount of merchandise they sell. It's convenient, not super crowded, has an overall good selection. Ironically, prices aren't much more than other nearby stores and sometimes even less! Even though the parking lot in the back of the store is a drag sometimes; in general, I find this place very appealing and useful a lot of the time. Plus, all of the classic 'Trader Joe' items are sometimes things you cannot get elsewhere, just making the stop here more worthwhile. Jean (a cashier), and Steve (it looked like he was a manager), were both very friendly and very knowledgeable about their store and other nearby Trader Joe's stores. I will definitely be returning here. 5 stars."
Bessie M.,"Boston, MA",4,5/30/16,I really like Trader Joe's!A co-worker and I were talking about where we go grocery shopping. And she suggested I try out Trader Joe's. The prices are reasonable and the quality is great.  I especially love the selection.  I love the spinach and greens they have on the shelves. It can be a bit busy on Sunday's but not as overwhelming as stop and shop or whole foods.

Maria G.,"Boston, MA",4,9/23/19,"My go-to grocery store in the area. I like the BlueBikes station located right outside of the store. The bus stop also makes it convenient but often runs behind schedule due to traffic.Generally speaking, Trader Joe's is good for grocery shopping if you are only preparing meals for one or two people. If you are prepping for a large meal, price-wise you are better off at Stop & Shop or other chains. Plus, if you look at their produce sections, the portion size is generally good for smaller meals. Their liquor selection is pretty solid. You can buy cheap (yet tasty) wine/spirit and also expensive ones. Sometimes they will have a table for wine & cheese tasting. Not five stars because I never understand why they don't run sales on produce or fruit. If you want to buy fresh berries, the sale prices at other grocery chains are way better. Also, this location carries most of your household needs, but lack some essentials like aluminum foil and stuff. Not sure why.The cashiers here have been generally pleasant. Occasionally you will run into grumpy ones. You do have to pay extra for the paper bags, so bring your own shopping bag."

The aisles are very spacious and every time I've gone it hasn't been too crowded which is such a blessing. Everything is clearly laid out and you can easily find what you're looking for.

Affordable prices."
Latoya G.,"East Brunswick, NJ",5,3/8/18,"I'm not from Boston, but on a quick visit to see a friend (who just so happens to live in the upstairs apartments--lucky dude).. I just had to do a quick shopping trip at one of my favorite chains--so cool to be able to walk downstairs to grocery shop!Location is clean, I found everything that I was looking for.. staff was friendly. My LO was hungry and I was looking for something quick to feed her, so when they were giving out samples of the pepperoni mac and cheese, we were quick to give it a try. DELICIOUS. That was her dinner for the night. Also, there was a wine tasting (my location never does that..) and even though I didn't end up getting of those brands, I did leave with about 3 very affordable bottles of red. I love that the part that sells alcohol is off in its own section.. it's not that way in mine, it's just another aisle.It was a super blustery, rainy, windy night and I was concerned about trekking the paper bags through that.. even though not that far to get back into his apartment, it was serious outside. Apparently, nothing could break these bags down because they were super solid through the wet weather.Great experience at this location, TJ."
Qme Z.,"Boston, MA",5,2/16/19,"This is by far the best Trader Joe's I've been to. It's spacious and very clean. The staff is friendly, I never have any issues finding what I need. There's a good wine selection too. Also they validate for one hour garage parking!"

I've never seen a trader Joe's so empty on the weekend in my life. I guess since this location is pretty new it hasn't been overrun by students yet.Anyways, this is your standard store. Shelves were stocked. Employees were friendly. Large windows let the nice sunshine come through. Plenty of employees working the check out stands.This location also has parking in the back. And a large selection of alcohol."
Jacklyn P.,"Sugar Land, TX",4,11/30/18,I love trader Joe's! It's close to my work and I always find myself trying new things from the store! It has a lot of variety to choose from and it's a nice switch up from your normal stop and shop.
Shayna K.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",4,9/21/18,"I love how Trader Joe's offers small cups of coffee AND puts out their soy creamer to add to the coffee. It is always a treat for me when I shop in this store. I also love how they have some drinkable kosher wine for $5.99.I wish the chocolate was ethically sourced. I go by the Food Empowerment Project's list of ethical chocolate and only buy what is ""Recommended"" by them. Trader Joe's has chosen not to disclose to the FEP where they source their chocolate. The produce is OK - not the highlight of the store, but certainly not bad. All of the plastic that they use for their precut vegetables is an environmental concern for me. I love the garage parking and validation by Trader Joes - no need to worry about shlepping groceries to the car in rain or snow.I wish more of their products (including cookies and crackers) were vegan."
Jo C.,"Worcester, MA",5,6/22/18,"This place is huge, clean and well organized.  They even have a free underground parking lot.  This is one of the less busy TJ's I've been to which I can see why since there is not much in the location and it's more easily accessed by car."
Nancy L.,"Boston, MA",5,1/31/18,Closest market for me to shop and they're super clean. Service is absolutely great!!! I see that on the weekends the manager of the market will help customers push out their carts and help them load into their car in winter temps. Each aisle is super spacious. Please restock the baby grapes! I love a lot of their sweets from bakery goods to the dry sweets on top of the frozen aisles.
Jenny S.,"Boston, MA",5,1/13/18,"Hands down the BEST Trader Joe's in the area. Very spacious location and not overly crowded or hectic like the other Trader Joe's locations in the Boston/Cambridge area (was hesitant to even write a review of this place out of fear it would get more crowded, but the large amount of space can handle crowds anyways). The isles are very wide, which leaves plenty of room for everyone to fit.Other perks include:- Free parking- Beer/wine (which is missing from the Trader Joe's in Cambridge)- Great staff (which is true of all Trader Joe's locations)- Items restock quickly (which is not the case in Coolidge Corner on weekends)- Not hecticWhile other locations are more convenient for me, I go out of my way to come to this Trader Joe's because I love it so much."
Grace C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,1/3/18,"Great new space. I live very close to all 3 Trader Joe's (Brookline, Lower Allston, and Cambridge) and find it strange that they are so close in distance but this one is a little quieter. Even in this blizzard madness, I did not feel rushed or stressed out. Apparently parking garage is free for the first hour. I risk the Harvard parking nearby or look for the free 2 hour parking nearby."
Jessica C.,"Boston, MA",5,3/8/18,"The best Tj's! I'm so comfortable here--from the garage parking, to the friendly staff we know by name and to the awesome products. There is one hour validated parking and there are always plenty of large parking spots available. Then there is stair or elevator access to the shopping level and everything is new. I'm happy this TJ's is so spacious, I even allow my kids to do their ""own shopping."" They are comfortable with the layout of the store, they know where to grab the products they like. The staff always hides Bella the pig and awards the kids with lollipops and stickers too. This store is always super  well stocked and I just love how clean and big it is. Last time, there was even a really nice girl who pro actively asked me if she could help me find anything and another time a staff member shared with me his chili recipe (as I forgot my recipe and the phone service was spotty.)it's always so nice to be around helpful ppl and this TJ's is doing such a great job.

Hope W.,"Boston, MA",5,8/9/18,"Can't really go wrong with a Trader Joe's, but this one is especially great. A lot of GF options I haven't seen at other Trader Joe's, validated parking (!!!), and super friendly workers. Huge beer/wine/spirits section. There's almost always ice cream samples at night. Affordable prices."
Latoya G.,"East Brunswick, NJ",5,3/8/18,"I'm not from Boston, but on a quick visit to see a friend (who just so happens to live in the upstairs apartments--lucky dude).. I just had to do a quick shopping trip at one of my favorite chains--so cool to be able to walk downstairs to grocery shop!Location is clean, I found everything that I was looking for.. staff was friendly. My LO was hungry and I was looking for something quick to feed her, so when they were giving out samples of the pepperoni mac and cheese, we were quick to give it a try. DELICIOUS. That was her dinner for the night. Also, there was a wine tasting (my location never does that..) and even though I didn't end up getting of those brands, I did leave with about 3 very affordable bottles of red. I love that the part that sells alcohol is off in its own section.. it's not that way in mine, it's just another aisle.It was a super blustery, rainy, windy night and I was concerned about trekking the paper bags through that.. even though not that far to get back into his apartment, it was serious outside. Apparently, nothing could break these bags down because they were super solid through the wet weather.Great experience at this location, TJ."
Qme Z.,"Boston, MA",5,2/16/19,"This is by far the best Trader Joe's I've been to. It's spacious and very clean. The staff is friendly, I never have any issues finding what I need. There's a good wine selection too. Also they validate for one hour garage parking!"
Caroline D.,"Lower Allston, Boston, MA",2,1/7/20,"Disappointed. The last few times I've been here, every banana has been extremely green and I've had to go elsewhere."
Goku U.,"Berkeley, CA",5,10/23/17,"Trader Joe's in Alston! I guess those Harvard students need to be fed somehow. I came here on a Saturday afternoon. I've never seen a trader Joe's so empty on the weekend in my life. I guess since this location is pretty new it hasn't been overrun by students yet.Anyways, this is your standard store. Shelves were stocked. Employees were friendly. Large windows let the nice sunshine come through. Plenty of employees working the check out stands.This location also has parking in the back. And a large selection of alcohol."
Jacklyn P.,"Sugar Land, TX",4,11/30/18,I love trader Joe's! It's close to my work and I always find myself trying new things from the store! It has a lot of variety to choose from and it's a nice switch up from your normal stop and shop.
Shayna K.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",4,9/21/18,"I love how Trader Joe's offers small cups of coffee AND puts out their soy creamer to add to the coffee. It is always a treat for me when I shop in this store. I also love how they have some drinkable kosher wine for $5.99.I wish the chocolate was ethically sourced. I go by the Food Empowerment Project's list of ethical chocolate and only buy what is ""Recommended"" by them. Trader Joe's has chosen not to disclose to the FEP where they source their chocolate. The produce is OK - not the highlight of the store, but certainly not bad. All of the plastic that they use for their precut vegetables is an environmental concern for me. I love the garage parking and validation by Trader Joes - no need to worry about shlepping groceries to the car in rain or snow.I wish more of their products (including cookies and crackers) were vegan."
Jo C.,"Worcester, MA",5,6/22/18,"This place is huge, clean and well organized.  They even have a free underground parking lot.  This is one of the less busy TJ's I've been to which I can see why since there is not much in the location and it's more easily accessed by car."
Nancy L.,"Boston, MA",5,1/31/18,Closest market for me to shop and they're super clean. Service is absolutely great!!! I see that on the weekends the manager of the market will help customers push out their carts and help them load into their car in winter temps. Each aisle is super spacious. Please restock the baby grapes! I love a lot of their sweets from bakery goods to the dry sweets on top of the frozen aisles.
Jenny S.,"Boston, MA",5,1/13/18,"Hands down the BEST Trader Joe's in the area. Very spacious location and not overly crowded or hectic like the other Trader Joe's locations in the Boston/Cambridge area (was hesitant to even write a review of this place out of fear it would get more crowded, but the large amount of space can handle crowds anyways). The isles are very wide, which leaves plenty of room for everyone to fit.Other perks include:- Free parking- Beer/wine (which is missing from the Trader Joe's in Cambridge)- Great staff (which is true of all Trader Joe's locations)- Items restock quickly (which is not the case in Coolidge Corner on weekends)- Not hecticWhile other locations are more convenient for me, I go out of my way to come to this Trader Joe's because I love it so much."
Grace C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,1/3/18,"Great new space. I live very close to all 3 Trader Joe's (Brookline, Lower Allston, and Cambridge) and find it strange that they are so close in distance but this one is a little quieter. Even in this blizzard madness, I did not feel rushed or stressed out. Apparently parking garage is free for the first hour. I risk the Harvard parking nearby or look for the free 2 hour parking nearby."
Jessica C.,"Boston, MA",5,3/8/18,"The best Tj's! I'm so comfortable here--from the garage parking, to the friendly staff we know by name and to the awesome products. There is one hour validated parking and there are always plenty of large parking spots available. Then there is stair or elevator access to the shopping level and everything is new. I'm happy this TJ's is so spacious, I even allow my kids to do their ""own shopping."" They are comfortable with the layout of the store, they know where to grab the products they like. The staff always hides Bella the pig and awards the kids with lollipops and stickers too. This store is always super  well stocked and I just love how clean and big it is. Last time, there was even a really nice girl who pro actively asked me if she could help me find anything and another time a staff member shared with me his chili recipe (as I forgot my recipe and the phone service was spotty.)it's always so nice to be around helpful ppl and this TJ's is doing such a great job. Also, It is never too packed, unlike the brookline or mem dr locations, I'm always happy shopping here!"
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,9/4/20,"Came back during COVID. There is an employee at the entrance spraying hand sanitizer on everyone's hand. Go during the day, so it won't be crowded! There are also super high plexi glass barriers at all the cashiers. Here are some of my favorite TJ items:-Unexpected cheddar. The employees there recommended it to me and its unexpectedly good!-Everything but the bagel seasoning- goes well on everything. -Everything but the elote seasoning- amazing for Mexican corn -Frozen Mac N cheese- a guilty pleasure of mine-Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and conditioner"
Marissa R.,"Boston, MA",4,8/10/19,"According to their cheeky signage, this is the smallest TJ location in the *universe*! That being said, I'm reviewing it for what it is: a VERY SMALL but FUNCTIONAL location. Plus, it's kinda cool being in such a unique store. It feels like you're in Trader Joe's secret underground location!Despite the size, they seem to carry everything the full size stores do. I've rarely seen low stock here. The crew members are all very helpful if you can't find something specific. Lines are usually a bit long, but they go quickly. This location isn't my first choice because I like to peruse without bumping into the others in the aisle, but it does its job!"
Jessi F.,"Boston, MA",4,6/10/19,"I love Trader Joe's. In a city filled with overpriced grocery stores, it's refreshing that TJ's offers affordable, adventurous, and high-quality products. Usually I'd give TJ's 5 stars, but this particular store is so small that it makes the shopping experience pretty stressful. During peak hours (after work or weekends) the line will often go around the entire store. And sometimes there's even a line just to get into the store before you shop! Plus, unlike other locations, this one doesn't sell alcohol.My advice? Opt for the one in Brookline, Cambridge, or Somerville. You'll likely have a calmer shopping experience and the possibility of buying $3 wine!"
Jason K.,"Boston, MA",4,11/9/18,"Great customer service from the cashiers during my quick trips here to grab seaweed. It's pretty cramped so brace yourself if you don't like being crowded in a small area with a bunch of people. Also, note that since you are in the Back Bay area, you are kinda out of luck for parking since Boston, in general, isn't well known for being friendly to drivers. Decent location, just note that you will be in a very compressed area with a lot of people.IG: Mood4foodeatery"
Julie D.,"Anchorage, AK",5,10/19/18,So my five star review may be a little biased as I live in a state that does not have and in all reality never will have a TJ's for me to shop at. Therefore this TJ's gets five stars from me just for location! I mean really? How cool to be able to be in the city and drop on by for some much needed items. It is very accessible from the T and even though it it tiny it had all the items I wanted. The customer service was excellent and the line was not that long I waited at the most two minutes to be checked out.AND I got to take a picture of the smallest TJ's in the known universe so BONUS!!

Julie D.,"Anchorage, AK",5,10/19/18,So my five star review may be a little biased as I live in a state that does not have and in all reality never will have a TJ's for me to shop at. Therefore this TJ's gets five stars from me just for location! I mean really? How cool to be able to be in the city and drop on by for some much needed items. It is very accessible from the T and even though it it tiny it had all the items I wanted.

Rudy P.,"Newburgh, NY",3,9/2/19,Helpful staff with limited choices. Disappointed to see them filling the shelves with new stock in front! Anyone who knows retail knows you stock shelves from the back. Just means we the customers get older merch.

Robert S.,"South Tewksbury, Tewksbury, MA",5,6/26/19,"Definitely one of the more unique Trader Joe's I have been to, it is located next to the Prudential Center.

It is quite smaller than most as it appears to be in the basement of the building it is in and even sports a sign that reads something along the lines of ""smallest Trader Joe's in the known universe"" I believe- that smaller environment makes it seem more like a small market than a chain grocery store.

Adwoa B.,"Boston, MA",5,10/15/18,Trader Joe's is life. Best customer service always and every one of them I've been to. The food products are to die for and for the location I live in this is one of the reasonably priced restaurants in the area.
Lemuel L.,"Boston, MA",4,4/23/18,"I go to two Trader Joe's frequently, this one and the other one in Coolidge Corner. I've never had a bad experience in both.

I love grabbing their bags of avocados, sausage, uncured bacon (YES!), cheese, snacks like pretzel thins... The selection is great.

Robert S.,"South Tewksbury, Tewksbury, MA",5,6/26/19,"Definitely one of the more unique Trader Joe's I have been to, it is located next to the Prudential Center. If you're ever in the area and need to go food shopping, this Trader Joe's is a good location! It is quite smaller than most as it appears to be in the basement of the building it is in and even sports a sign that reads something along the lines of ""smallest Trader Joe's in the known universe"" I believe- that smaller environment makes it seem more like a small market than a chain grocery store.

Julie D.,"Anchorage, AK",5,10/19/18,So my five star review may be a little biased as I live in a state that does not have and in all reality never will have a TJ's for me to shop at. Therefore this TJ's gets five stars from me just for location! I mean really? How cool to be able to be in the city and drop on by for some much needed items. It is very accessible from the T and even though it it tiny it had all the items I wanted. The customer service was excellent and the line was not that long I waited at the most two minutes to be checked out.AND I got to take a picture of the smallest TJ's in the known universe so BONUS!!

Julie D.,"Anchorage, AK",5,10/19/18,So my five star review may be a little biased as I live in a state that does not have and in all reality never will have a TJ's for me to shop at. Therefore this TJ's gets five stars from me just for location! I mean really? How cool to be able to be in the city and drop on by for some much needed items. It is very accessible from the T and even though it it tiny it had all the items I wanted. The customer service was excellent and the line was not that long I waited at the most two minutes to be checked out.AND I got to take a picture of the smallest TJ's in the known universe so BONUS!!
Paria S.,"Boston, MA",5,9/27/19,"Is there a better grocery store out there?! I don't usually review grocery stores, but I felt the need to share my experience.

He offered to help me by carrying the stroller down, which I declined because I'd have to take baby out for him to do that and I didn't want to wake baby.

Robert S.,"South Tewksbury, Tewksbury, MA",5,6/26/19,"Definitely one of the more unique Trader Joe's I have been to, it is located next to the Prudential Center. If you're ever in the area and need to go food shopping, this Trader Joe's is a good location! It is quite smaller than most as it appears to be in the basement of the building it is in and even sports a sign that reads something along the lines of ""smallest Trader Joe's in the known universe"" I believe- that smaller environment makes it seem more like a small market than a chain grocery store. Even though it is a chain, Trader How's does a good job at feeling like it isn't a chain and I like that! It also caters to the area it is in with references to it and this one is no different. Great place for food shopping overall."
Adwoa B.,"Boston, MA",5,10/15/18,Trader Joe's is life. Best customer service always and every one of them I've been to. The food products are to die for and for the location I live in this is one of the reasonably priced restaurants in the area.
Lemuel L.,"Boston, MA",4,4/23/18,"I go to two Trader Joe's frequently, this one and the other one in Coolidge Corner. I've never had a bad experience in both. It's actually amazing how much this location is able to fit into such a tight space. That being said, it's practically shopping gridlock if you show up here during peak times. The line will actually start to weave through the aisles and you couldn't tell if that person was being super indecisive about which brand of olive oil to buy  or if they were on line. This location is the smallest Trader Joe's I've been in and despite it not having an alcohol section, it does carry all the essentials you will need in a typical grocery run. As always, service is always great and the staff aren't afraid to show their appreciation when you use a reusable bag."
Cindy H.,"Boston, MA",4,6/4/17,"Very crowded and chaotic, but I absolutely love coming here. I never see my go-to's out of stock, and the staff is extremely friendly. If you've never been to Trader Joe's - it's no Whole Foods. The prices are low and there's a lot of prepared and frozen food choices. I love grabbing their bags of avocados, sausage, uncured bacon (YES!), cheese, snacks like pretzel thins... The selection is great. The vegetables and fruit are always cheap and fresh too, definitely way better than the Star Market down the street.The line to check out might be daunting but it goes real quick. They serve samples time to time too!"
Alex H.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/11/17,"One of the smallest Joe's on Earth, but clearly one of the best! All the staff here are friendly and treat you like REAL HUMAN BEINGS unlike other grocery stores.

It is very accessible from the T and even though it it tiny it had all the items I wanted. The customer service was excellent and the line was not that long I waited at the most two minutes to be checked out.AND I got to take a picture of the smallest TJ's in the known universe so BONUS!!
Paria S.,"Boston, MA",5,9/27/19,"Is there a better grocery store out there?! I don't usually review grocery stores, but I felt the need to share my experience. A couple of days ago I walked in to get a few items with my sleeping baby in the stroller. The small handicap lift was out of order and as I turned back to walk out the door one of the staff saw me and asked if he could help. He offered to help me by carrying the stroller down, which I declined because I'd have to take baby out for him to do that and I didn't want to wake baby. He then offered to do my shopping for me and insisted when I was hesitant because I didn't want to trouble him. He promptly returned with the items, and when I offered to tip him he didn't accept, saying, ""don't worry, trader joe's takes care of us.""  No wonder they're all so happy and friendly all the time!

Christine B.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",3,5/2/18,"I love Trader Joe's, but I tend to avoid this particular location just because it's tiny size makes shopping a bit of a nuisance.

Sarah M.,"Quincy, MA",1,2/12/20,"I come to this location often and it's one of my favorite Trader Joe's. However, today my experience wasn't that great.

Robert S.,"South Tewksbury, Tewksbury, MA",5,6/26/19,"Definitely one of the more unique Trader Joe's I have been to, it is located next to the Prudential Center. If you're ever in the area and need to go food shopping, this Trader Joe's is a good location! It is quite smaller than most as it appears to be in the basement of the building it is in and even sports a sign that reads something along the lines of ""smallest Trader Joe's in the known universe"" I believe- that smaller environment makes it seem more like a small market than a chain grocery store. Even though it is a chain, Trader How's does a good job at feeling like it isn't a chain and I like that! It also caters to the area it is in with references to it and this one is no different. Great place for food shopping overall."
Adwoa B.,"Boston, MA",5,10/15/18,Trader Joe's is life. Best customer service always and every one of them I've been to. The food products are to die for and for the location I live in this is one of the reasonably priced restaurants in the area.
Lemuel L.,"Boston, MA",4,4/23/18,"I go to two Trader Joe's frequently, this one and the other one in Coolidge Corner. I've never had a bad experience in both. It's actually amazing how much this location is able to fit into such a tight space. That being said, it's practically shopping gridlock if you show up here during peak times. The line will actually start to weave through the aisles and you couldn't tell if that person was being super indecisive about which brand of olive oil to buy  or if they were on line. This location is the smallest Trader Joe's I've been in and despite it not having an alcohol section, it does carry all the essentials you will need in a typical grocery run. As always, service is always great and the staff aren't afraid to show their appreciation when you use a reusable bag."
Cindy H.,"Boston, MA",4,6/4/17,"Very crowded and chaotic, but I absolutely love coming here. I never see my go-to's out of stock, and the staff is extremely friendly. If you've never been to Trader Joe's - it's no Whole Foods. The prices are low and there's a lot of prepared and frozen food choices. I love grabbing their bags of avocados, sausage, uncured bacon (YES!), cheese, snacks like pretzel thins... The selection is great. The vegetables and fruit are always cheap and fresh too, definitely way better than the Star Market down the street.The line to check out might be daunting but it goes real quick. They serve samples time to time too!"
Alex H.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/11/17,"One of the smallest Joe's on Earth, but clearly one of the best! All the staff here are friendly and treat you like REAL HUMAN BEINGS unlike other grocery stores. The only downside is that they don't sell beer, but they truly make up for it in all the stuff they do sell! :)Here are some of my favs:- Pork and Chicken Gyozas for 2.99- Garlic Dip = delish! - Trader Joe's Mayonnaise - Huge chocolate bars for 4.99 (I love their milk chocolate with almonds)- Spicy Dried Mangos (taste just like Mexican mangoes!)"
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,9/4/20,"Came back during COVID. There is an employee at the entrance spraying hand sanitizer on everyone's hand. Go during the day, so it won't be crowded! There are also super high plexi glass barriers at all the cashiers. Here are some of my favorite TJ items:-Unexpected cheddar. The employees there recommended it to me and its unexpectedly good!-Everything but the bagel seasoning- goes well on everything. -Everything but the elote seasoning- amazing for Mexican corn -Frozen Mac N cheese- a guilty pleasure of mine-Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and conditioner"
Marissa R.,"Boston, MA",4,8/10/19,"According to their cheeky signage, this is the smallest TJ location in the *universe*! That being said, I'm reviewing it for what it is: a VERY SMALL but FUNCTIONAL location. Plus, it's kinda cool being in such a unique store. It feels like you're in Trader Joe's secret underground location!Despite the size, they seem to carry everything the full size stores do. I've rarely seen low stock here. The crew members are all very helpful if you can't find something specific. Lines are usually a bit long, but they go quickly. This location isn't my first choice because I like to peruse without bumping into the others in the aisle, but it does its job!"
Jessi F.,"Boston, MA",4,6/10/19,"I love Trader Joe's. In a city filled with overpriced grocery stores, it's refreshing that TJ's offers affordable, adventurous, and high-quality products. Usually I'd give TJ's 5 stars, but this particular store is so small that it makes the shopping experience pretty stressful. During peak hours (after work or weekends) the line will often go around the entire store. And sometimes there's even a line just to get into the store before you shop! Plus, unlike other locations, this one doesn't sell alcohol.My advice? Opt for the one in Brookline, Cambridge, or Somerville. You'll likely have a calmer shopping experience and the possibility of buying $3 wine!"
Jason K.,"Boston, MA",4,11/9/18,"Great customer service from the cashiers during my quick trips here to grab seaweed. It's pretty cramped so brace yourself if you don't like being crowded in a small area with a bunch of people. Also, note that since you are in the Back Bay area, you are kinda out of luck for parking since Boston, in general, isn't well known for being friendly to drivers. Decent location, just note that you will be in a very compressed area with a lot of people.IG: Mood4foodeatery"

It is quite smaller than most as it appears to be in the basement of the building it is in and even sports a sign that reads something along the lines of ""smallest Trader Joe's in the known universe"" I believe- that smaller environment makes it seem more like a small market than a chain grocery store. Even though it is a chain, Trader How's does a good job at feeling like it isn't a chain and I like that! It also caters to the area it is in with references to it and this one is no different. Great place for food shopping overall."
Adwoa B.,"Boston, MA",5,10/15/18,Trader Joe's is life. Best customer service always and every one of them I've been to. The food products are to die for and for the location I live in this is one of the reasonably priced restaurants in the area.
Lemuel L.,"Boston, MA",4,4/23/18,"I go to two Trader Joe's frequently, this one and the other one in Coolidge Corner. I've never had a bad experience in both. It's actually amazing how much this location is able to fit into such a tight space. That being said, it's practically shopping gridlock if you show up here during peak times. The line will actually start to weave through the aisles and you couldn't tell if that person was being super indecisive about which brand of olive oil to buy  or if they were on line. This location is the smallest Trader Joe's I've been in and despite it not having an alcohol section, it does carry all the essentials you will need in a typical grocery run. As always, service is always great and the staff aren't afraid to show their appreciation when you use a reusable bag."
Cindy H.,"Boston, MA",4,6/4/17,"Very crowded and chaotic, but I absolutely love coming here. I never see my go-to's out of stock, and the staff is extremely friendly. If you've never been to Trader Joe's - it's no Whole Foods. The prices are low and there's a lot of prepared and frozen food choices. I love grabbing their bags of avocados, sausage, uncured bacon (YES!), cheese, snacks like pretzel thins... The selection is great. The vegetables and fruit are always cheap and fresh too, definitely way better than the Star Market down the street.The line to check out might be daunting but it goes real quick. They serve samples time to time too!"
Alex H.,"Seattle, WA",5,8/11/17,"One of the smallest Joe's on Earth, but clearly one of the best! All the staff here are friendly and treat you like REAL HUMAN BEINGS unlike other grocery stores. The only downside is that they don't sell beer, but they truly make up for it in all the stuff they do sell! :)Here are some of my favs:- Pork and Chicken Gyozas for 2.99- Garlic Dip = delish! - Trader Joe's Mayonnaise - Huge chocolate bars for 4.99 (I love their milk chocolate with almonds)- Spicy Dried Mangos (taste just like Mexican mangoes!)"
Brett M.,"Wilmington, MA",5,6/20/20,"Ok the employees were so nice! In a pandemic! What a pleasant shopping experience. Oh, and this Trader Joe's is rather large, with a good selection."
Bea T.,"West Roxbury, MA",4,1/18/20,Nice and lofty looking Trader Joe's. Same stuff that you find in any other trader Joe's. Staff is pleasant. I got me some croissants and cheap pasta. A great deal... Love trader Joe's.
Rebecca S.,"Boston, MA",5,7/19/20,"I am Trader Joe's obsessed. I go every week and I'm always impressed, but I was especially impressed with my experience with Godefa from the Seaport Trader Joe's. I love talking Trader Joe's products and we talked about all the different products we both loved that the checkout experience was just like chatting with an old friend. He went above and beyond for me (as I bought too much), and helped me carry my bags out to my car. Such a lovely experience with Godefa and the entire Seaport Trader Joe's team. Thanks for always being awesome"
Alex B.,"Burlington, MA",5,10/25/19,"Welcome addition to the neighborhood!  Great produce, nuts, cereals, and prepared foods."
G D.,"Quincy, MA",5,12/16/19,"Trader Joes is great, as everyone knows.The Seaport is overly expensive and lacks quality grocery options, as everyone also knows.Thus, Trader Joes taking up residence here is a godsend and absolute perfect match.This is a very large store (by TJs and Seaport standards), totally brand new inside of an old shell, with high ceilings and a well lit, super clean industrial design.  It contains a huge selection of TJs renowned brand name goods, as well as some surprising augments. The Achilles heel of this place (for outsiders) will be easy parking.There are a few short term paid spots on Seaport Blvd ... but other than that? Good luck.  Don't drive here.However, this location is right next to Courthouse (Silver Line) and only a half mile (scenic) walk over the bridge from South Station (Red Line).It is also pretty ideally and centrally located for workers / residents of the Seaport & Financial District.Given the lack of any real competition and the massive demand for quick and easy quality groceries among the well compensated locals, I can't see how this place won't be a total revenue monster.Five Stars."
Lacie C.,"Boston, MA",5,6/20/20,"Hi! Its not a secret I'm obsessed with Trader Joe's. The selection of different food, the employees, just the store itself makes it so much better to grocery shop! I wanted to praise one of the checkout clerks. His name is Godefa and was the sweetest, nicest, most caring man who went the extra mile. He bagged all of my produce for me that I brought to the register without bags, he bagged all my meat for me, and then, since we have to bag our own groceries outside the store if we bring reusable bags, he laid my cart out in the most perfect organized way to make it easier on me to bag. He also let me open up my asparagus before I bought them since I've have to return the last 2 bags I bought becuase they were bad. He was amazing and I just wanted to give him a shoutout and let everyone know that this employee is amazing if you ever have the chance to interact with him! I hope Trader Joe's in the seaport shows this to him as well!"
M M.,"Boston, MA",5,2/6/20,"I love TJ's because of its reasonable prices, polite and helpful staff and natural products.  This particular store is quite large and fills a void in a bustling neighborhood that is filled with apartments and condos.  (How Boston keeps developing new neighborhoods without thinking about necessities like grocery stores and pharmacies is a mystery to me.). Anyway--hip hooray Trader Joe's is here! It's big, it's right next to a Silverline stop, so bring your shopping trolley and take a ride or a brisk walk to the lovely Fort Point/Sea Port neighborhood!"
Andrea D.,"Boston, MA",5,10/26/19,"Awesome location! I went yesterday morning on the Grand Opening and just like all of the other Trader Joe's great selections of items and great friendly staff! As always great samples and a part of the opening one or two crew members was giving out delicious spice cupcakes with a delicious cream cheese tasting frosting! I will definitely come back and this location is easily accessible from South Station, Silver Line and since it's not far from Dorchester Avenue you can likely get there from Andrew and Broadway!!"
Guli K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,5/6/20,Lines moved fast and layout was well organized. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Was surprised at how well stocked they were during these times.
Anna F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/18/20,"I love this TJ's. It's my favorite one in the area. They are fully stocked, even in these times, and they were one of the first to take super precautions: lines with markers for standing 6ft apart, wipes for carts, now they're doing 1 way aisles. The staff is quite friendly too. Avocados from Mexico are always great to get, fresh herbs, cheeses, Italian prosciutto (my new favorite product), frozen goods (of course), kosher and organic meat, handmade flour tortillas, canned tomatoes grape leaves & green olives, teas, seltzer, and constantly lovely surprises."
H. S.,"Boston, MA",1,9/7/20,"When I mentioned to the employee behind the customer service counter early this morning on September 7 that masks should be worn above the nose, (both he and other employees were wearing masks below their nose and as chin straps) he lowered his mask completely, reached out his arm and stated that he was 6 feet away so ""no problem"" as he spoke at me.Given the respiratory transmission of this virus, the science we now know, and my experience as an ER doctor, I think it is inexcusable that Trader Joe's allows employees to not wear a mask inside their stores unless they are ""within 6 feet of someone else"".  There is no excuse for putting the lives of their customers, employees and family members at risk at risk with a store policy."
Sfo B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,8/7/19,"I love Trader Joe's stores. Their stores are not nearly as big as the WF stores, but one can find many good products at an excellent price, often much better than the WF. I often get fruits and vegetables, olive oil, juice, pasta sauce and frozen foods from this store. One star deducted for not carrying beer and wine. I wish they carry these like other Trader Joe's stores."
Gretchen B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,12/28/19,"I LOVE Trader Joe's, and I especially love this particular store because their employees are so delightful. Everyone is always very helpful and has a great attitude. It makes shopping so much better when you're around kind people. One time, the person in front of me in line left the store and I got up to the register and noticed they walked out w/o their keys. I ran out the door and found them and gave them their keys. I came back in and the cashier had flowers for me that the lady working in the flower area picked out while I was in the parking lot giving the person their keys back. I was taken aback and the cashier said ""I like to celebrate good deeds and kindness. We need more of it in this world and I appreciate you ran out and gave this person their keys back. That was very nice."" I mean...WOW! I was floored and thanked him and the lady who was working in the flower area over and over. I certainly did not expect that for just doing the right thing that I'd hope anyone would do if they were my keys. This store gets VERY crowded on Sundays so I try to avoid it then, but any other time it's fine and easy to navigate through (except maybe before a winter storm...but aren't all stores in New England crowded then as people freak out?)I used to love that they carried wine at this store but now that the Allston store does, this one does not. It's OK though...they have all of the amazing Trader Joe's foods/products I love, and again, I cannot stress how awesome the employees are. It's a pleasure to shop here."
Diane Z.,"Fremont, CA",5,9/6/19,"5 stars for excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I come here regularly for groceries and have run into some issues such as meat going bad before the best-by date or having cracked eggs, but the staff are always happy to rectify the situation by allowing exchanges or refunds. We can always find someone to help us in the aisles which seems rare at a lot of stores these days, and the checkout line is never very long.The only downside I can think of is that you can't buy alcohol here now (although you used to be able to). But otherwise fair prices, good quality (if not, you can exchange or refund), lots of variety, friendly staff! Definitely a go-to grocery store!"
DC R.,"Washington, DC",5,9/29/19,Great experience. And amazing selections! Better than my local.Trader Joe's is my first priority on a trip!Easy access in Cambridge.
Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4,4/25/19,"I come here all the time to grocery shop, especially for snacks, for which they have a very wide selection. Don't be fooled though, not all of their prices are cheaper than competitors (including Whole Foods), so you gotta do your research. I especially love their mini mochi and cold brew latte pops. Do not buy their flowers no matter how tempted you may be by the low prices. They wither in about a day. And they no longer sell alcohol at this location. Sad."
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,6/23/18,"Average Trader Joe's and nothing special about this location. No food samples today :(Otherwise, place is clean and cashiers are friendly."
Tessa M.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",5,7/28/19,"I am a Trader Joes somewhat newbie, as they were not prevalently featured in areas I lived until three years ago. This Traders has a lovely selection and is well-kept (clean, nothing expired on the shelves, all produce tasty/fresh). It is a nicely sized location with convenient parking, and a Starbucks right next door if you need a quick fix. The associates are nice and friendly, one of which I now look for every time I come in, as she is such a sweet person! This is certainly my Traders of choice. It only has one flaw, which is when you try to leave you can only turn right and traffic makes uturning difficult if you came from the other direction. Otherwise, perfection!"
Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6/13/17,"How can you not like Trader Joes? It's like Whole Foods, but affordable and friendly for the entire family. Also, they have $3 buck wine! That's amazing!Similar to the other trader joes, this market has the standard joe-goods and has a fairly sizable parking lot. The flowers are always in season and they often have some fancy free dishes in the back corner. I will say that their card selection is slightly limited and they don't always have free coffee. But that's just picking at small things."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,6/15/17,"This place is crowded during the weekend, but its nowhere as crowded as the TJ in NYC's Union Square. You can push a cart around this TJ. The wine section is in the supermarket (its not a separate wine store) so you definitely need a cart. There is ample, free parking outside. It is not covered, but hey, its free!Some of my favorite items to buy are:-snap peas-Any meat that has flavor added, like the bulgogi beef.-Snacks. The snack aisle is my favorite aisle. Cheddar puffs, green pea snacks, tortilla chips and salsa. Mixed nuts. -Frozen food. I wasn't able to find the cauliflower pizza crust or mashed cauliflower. Maybe it was sold out.-Wines. $3 wine for making sangria. Reislings are cheap too. If you forget to bring a bag like me, you will be charged 10 cents per bag."
George H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,10/31/18,Relatively cheap grocery store in the area with a solid offering.Really love the trader Joe's branded snacks
Michael D.,"Providence, RI",5,4/16/19,"Nice store with a great friendly staff.  I visit often & Dave, the manager always goes out of his way to welcome me.  Always clean & so neatly organized.  Great music too."

Court S.,"Oakland, CA",5,1/7/15,I've written a few reviews for Trader Joe's so I'm only limiting this review to their wine selection. I love all Tj's however this location has wine for sale. On one occasion they were providing samples of champagne.  Now that how I like to shop! I usually come here when I need to get a gift for someone and you never go wrong with a nice inexpensive bottle of wine for $5.99. I especially love that there are a few experts that will help you select the appropriate wine based on the gift receiver's demographic. Cheers!

Aditi V.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/19/17,"This is by far my favorite place to buy groceries. The produce is fresh and inexpensive. Also a pretty good selection of cheese and wine (probably the most inexpensive wine selection in the Boston area - inexpensive but good ! Get the Rieslings if that's your thing. They're really good here)In the frozen food sections - the dumplings , pork buns and cioppino (seafood stew) are delicious. Pro tip: NEVER shop here on a Sunday evening. It will be insanely crowded."
Vadim S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/19,"Trader Joe's makes me happy! I go there every week to get groceries and I find something new to try every time :-) They have a fun selection of products, lots of ready to eat or easy to cook items which saves a lot of my time and are quite delicious. I like their fresh produce section, the cheese (of course!) and the seafood sections. Most of my food comes from Trader Joe's and it's a great shopping experience every time!"
Mike Y.,"Cambridge, MA",1,7/7/18,"Around 8 PM on July 7, my cashier, N. Hannah, allowed my apples to fall on the floor and just put them back on the checkout belt like they hadn't just rolled under the station behind her. When my boyfriend said that we no longer needed an item, she told him to put it back. And when he left to do just that, she said to me, ""Are you roommates?"" I told her, no, that's my boyfriend. She just looked at me and said nothing-- just stared at me blankly. We're gay, there's nothing subtle about the way I treat my boyfriend in public, and I don't think the question was innocent. I noticed a large crucifix around her neck. We bagged everything in our own bags, and then she proceeded not to give us the bag discount. So, Point 1, don't let your employees ask about customers' private lives. I spent $160, but even if I had spent $5, it's none of your damn business.   Point 2, if you have religious beliefs that impel you to treat people differently, don't get a job that requires you to work with the public. If you're a nasty piece of work who doesn't get along with others, I hear working from home is nice.Point 3, if you have an employee that is giving out service that differs depending on whether she approves of the customer's lifestyle, you need to fire that person, and if you don't, that's on you."

I informed them it was in fact a Trader's Joe cookie, the Meyer Lemon thin ones, and they spent 3 employees and 30 minutes searching for it.

Their stores are not nearly as big as the WF stores, but one can find many good products at an excellent price, often much better than the WF. I often get fruits and vegetables, olive oil, juice, pasta sauce and frozen foods from this store. One star deducted for not carrying beer and wine. I wish they carry these like other Trader Joe's stores."
Gretchen B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,12/28/19,"I LOVE Trader Joe's, and I especially love this particular store because their employees are so delightful. Everyone is always very helpful and has a great attitude. It makes shopping so much better when you're around kind people. One time, the person in front of me in line left the store and I got up to the register and noticed they walked out w/o their keys. I ran out the door and found them and gave them their keys. I came back in and the cashier had flowers for me that the lady working in the flower area picked out while I was in the parking lot giving the person their keys back. I was taken aback and the cashier said ""I like to celebrate good deeds and kindness. We need more of it in this world and I appreciate you ran out and gave this person their keys back. That was very nice."" I mean...WOW! I was floored and thanked him and the lady who was working in the flower area over and over. I certainly did not expect that for just doing the right thing that I'd hope anyone would do if they were my keys. This store gets VERY crowded on Sundays so I try to avoid it then, but any other time it's fine and easy to navigate through (except maybe before a winter storm...but aren't all stores in New England crowded then as people freak out?)I used to love that they carried wine at this store but now that the Allston store does, this one does not. It's OK though...they have all of the amazing Trader Joe's foods/products I love, and again, I cannot stress how awesome the employees are. It's a pleasure to shop here."
Diane Z.,"Fremont, CA",5,9/6/19,"5 stars for excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I come here regularly for groceries and have run into some issues such as meat going bad before the best-by date or having cracked eggs, but the staff are always happy to rectify the situation by allowing exchanges or refunds. We can always find someone to help us in the aisles which seems rare at a lot of stores these days, and the checkout line is never very long.The only downside I can think of is that you can't buy alcohol here now (although you used to be able to). But otherwise fair prices, good quality (if not, you can exchange or refund), lots of variety, friendly staff! Definitely a go-to grocery store!"
DC R.,"Washington, DC",5,9/29/19,Great experience. And amazing selections! Better than my local.Trader Joe's is my first priority on a trip!Easy access in Cambridge.
Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4,4/25/19,"I come here all the time to grocery shop, especially for snacks, for which they have a very wide selection. Don't be fooled though, not all of their prices are cheaper than competitors (including Whole Foods), so you gotta do your research. I especially love their mini mochi and cold brew latte pops. Do not buy their flowers no matter how tempted you may be by the low prices. They wither in about a day. And they no longer sell alcohol at this location. Sad."
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,6/23/18,"Average Trader Joe's and nothing special about this location. No food samples today :(Otherwise, place is clean and cashiers are friendly."
Tessa M.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",5,7/28/19,"I am a Trader Joes somewhat newbie, as they were not prevalently featured in areas I lived until three years ago. This Traders has a lovely selection and is well-kept (clean, nothing expired on the shelves, all produce tasty/fresh). It is a nicely sized location with convenient parking, and a Starbucks right next door if you need a quick fix. The associates are nice and friendly, one of which I now look for every time I come in, as she is such a sweet person! This is certainly my Traders of choice. It only has one flaw, which is when you try to leave you can only turn right and traffic makes uturning difficult if you came from the other direction. Otherwise, perfection!"
Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6/13/17,"How can you not like Trader Joes? It's like Whole Foods, but affordable and friendly for the entire family. Also, they have $3 buck wine! That's amazing!Similar to the other trader joes, this market has the standard joe-goods and has a fairly sizable parking lot. The flowers are always in season and they often have some fancy free dishes in the back corner. I will say that their card selection is slightly limited and they don't always have free coffee. But that's just picking at small things."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,6/15/17,"This place is crowded during the weekend, but its nowhere as crowded as the TJ in NYC's Union Square. You can push a cart around this TJ. The wine section is in the supermarket (its not a separate wine store) so you definitely need a cart. There is ample, free parking outside. It is not covered, but hey, its free!Some of my favorite items to buy are:-snap peas-Any meat that has flavor added, like the bulgogi beef.-Snacks. The snack aisle is my favorite aisle. Cheddar puffs, green pea snacks, tortilla chips and salsa. Mixed nuts. -Frozen food. I wasn't able to find the cauliflower pizza crust or mashed cauliflower. Maybe it was sold out.-Wines. $3 wine for making sangria. Reislings are cheap too. If you forget to bring a bag like me, you will be charged 10 cents per bag."

Court S.,"Oakland, CA",5,1/7/15,I've written a few reviews for Trader Joe's so I'm only limiting this review to their wine selection. I love all Tj's however this location has wine for sale. On one occasion they were providing samples of champagne.  Now that how I like to shop! I usually come here when I need to get a gift for someone and you never go wrong with a nice inexpensive bottle of wine for $5.99.

Aditi V.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/19/17,"This is by far my favorite place to buy groceries. The produce is fresh and inexpensive. Also a pretty good selection of cheese and wine (probably the most inexpensive wine selection in the Boston area - inexpensive but good ! Get the Rieslings if that's your thing. They're really good here)In the frozen food sections - the dumplings , pork buns and cioppino (seafood stew) are delicious. Pro tip: NEVER shop here on a Sunday evening. It will be insanely crowded."
Vadim S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/19,"Trader Joe's makes me happy! I go there every week to get groceries and I find something new to try every time :-) They have a fun selection of products, lots of ready to eat or easy to cook items which saves a lot of my time and are quite delicious. I like their fresh produce section, the cheese (of course!) and the seafood sections. Most of my food comes from Trader Joe's and it's a great shopping experience every time!"
Mike Y.,"Cambridge, MA",1,7/7/18,"Around 8 PM on July 7, my cashier, N. Hannah, allowed my apples to fall on the floor and just put them back on the checkout belt like they hadn't just rolled under the station behind her. When my boyfriend said that we no longer needed an item, she told him to put it back. And when he left to do just that, she said to me, ""Are you roommates?"" I told her, no, that's my boyfriend. She just looked at me and said nothing-- just stared at me blankly. We're gay, there's nothing subtle about the way I treat my boyfriend in public, and I don't think the question was innocent. I noticed a large crucifix around her neck. We bagged everything in our own bags, and then she proceeded not to give us the bag discount. So, Point 1, don't let your employees ask about customers' private lives. I spent $160, but even if I had spent $5, it's none of your damn business.   Point 2, if you have religious beliefs that impel you to treat people differently, don't get a job that requires you to work with the public. If you're a nasty piece of work who doesn't get along with others, I hear working from home is nice.Point 3, if you have an employee that is giving out service that differs depending on whether she approves of the customer's lifestyle, you need to fire that person, and if you don't, that's on you."
Araxie Y.,"Malden, MA",5,3/21/16,"I've been to a handful of Trader Joe's but can't say I've found one thats blown me away with this kind of service.Aside from the usual shopping pleasures of delicious foods; I had one type of cookie I came hunting for at this location during my most recent visit. The staff couldn't find it on the shelves and were terribly curious to see if they had ordered it before at all. I informed them it was in fact a Trader's Joe cookie, the Meyer Lemon thin ones, and they spent 3 employees and 30 minutes searching for it. They found it in the inventory and managed to give me a few boxes during my checkout!Talk about amazing. What was even more incredible was the manager noticed there was no set place for those cookies on their shelves anymore so she had them make room and keep them in stock for good. Very happy with the outcome as I love these cookies and will be returning often for them!"
Guli K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,5/6/20,Lines moved fast and layout was well organized. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Was surprised at how well stocked they were during these times.
Anna F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/18/20,"I love this TJ's. It's my favorite one in the area. They are fully stocked, even in these times, and they were one of the first to take super precautions: lines with markers for standing 6ft apart, wipes for carts, now they're doing 1 way aisles. The staff is quite friendly too. Avocados from Mexico are always great to get, fresh herbs, cheeses, Italian prosciutto (my new favorite product), frozen goods (of course), kosher and organic meat, handmade flour tortillas, canned tomatoes grape leaves & green olives, teas, seltzer, and constantly lovely surprises."

She just looked at me and said nothing-- just stared at me blankly. We're gay, there's nothing subtle about the way I treat my boyfriend in public, and I don't think the question was innocent. I noticed a large crucifix around her neck. We bagged everything in our own bags, and then she proceeded not to give us the bag discount. So, Point 1, don't let your employees ask about customers' private lives. I spent $160, but even if I had spent $5, it's none of your damn business.   Point 2, if you have religious beliefs that impel you to treat people differently, don't get a job that requires you to work with the public. If you're a nasty piece of work who doesn't get along with others, I hear working from home is nice.Point 3, if you have an employee that is giving out service that differs depending on whether she approves of the customer's lifestyle, you need to fire that person, and if you don't, that's on you."
Araxie Y.,"Malden, MA",5,3/21/16,"I've been to a handful of Trader Joe's but can't say I've found one thats blown me away with this kind of service.Aside from the usual shopping pleasures of delicious foods; I had one type of cookie I came hunting for at this location during my most recent visit. The staff couldn't find it on the shelves and were terribly curious to see if they had ordered it before at all. I informed them it was in fact a Trader's Joe cookie, the Meyer Lemon thin ones, and they spent 3 employees and 30 minutes searching for it. They found it in the inventory and managed to give me a few boxes during my checkout!Talk about amazing. What was even more incredible was the manager noticed there was no set place for those cookies on their shelves anymore so she had them make room and keep them in stock for good. Very happy with the outcome as I love these cookies and will be returning often for them!"
Guli K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,5/6/20,Lines moved fast and layout was well organized. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Was surprised at how well stocked they were during these times.
Anna F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/18/20,"I love this TJ's. It's my favorite one in the area. They are fully stocked, even in these times, and they were one of the first to take super precautions: lines with markers for standing 6ft apart, wipes for carts, now they're doing 1 way aisles. The staff is quite friendly too. Avocados from Mexico are always great to get, fresh herbs, cheeses, Italian prosciutto (my new favorite product), frozen goods (of course), kosher and organic meat, handmade flour tortillas, canned tomatoes grape leaves & green olives, teas, seltzer, and constantly lovely surprises."
H.

Sfo B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,8/7/19,"I love Trader Joe's stores. Their stores are not nearly as big as the WF stores, but one can find many good products at an excellent price, often much better than the WF. I often get fruits and vegetables, olive oil, juice, pasta sauce and frozen foods from this store. One star deducted for not carrying beer and wine. I wish they carry these like other Trader Joe's stores."
Gretchen B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,12/28/19,"I LOVE Trader Joe's, and I especially love this particular store because their employees are so delightful. Everyone is always very helpful and has a great attitude. It makes shopping so much better when you're around kind people. One time, the person in front of me in line left the store and I got up to the register and noticed they walked out w/o their keys. I ran out the door and found them and gave them their keys. I came back in and the cashier had flowers for me that the lady working in the flower area picked out while I was in the parking lot giving the person their keys back. I was taken aback and the cashier said ""I like to celebrate good deeds and kindness. We need more of it in this world and I appreciate you ran out and gave this person their keys back. That was very nice."" I mean...WOW! I was floored and thanked him and the lady who was working in the flower area over and over. I certainly did not expect that for just doing the right thing that I'd hope anyone would do if they were my keys. This store gets VERY crowded on Sundays so I try to avoid it then, but any other time it's fine and easy to navigate through (except maybe before a winter storm...but aren't all stores in New England crowded then as people freak out?)I used to love that they carried wine at this store but now that the Allston store does, this one does not. It's OK though...they have all of the amazing Trader Joe's foods/products I love, and again, I cannot stress how awesome the employees are. It's a pleasure to shop here."
Diane Z.,"Fremont, CA",5,9/6/19,"5 stars for excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I come here regularly for groceries and have run into some issues such as meat going bad before the best-by date or having cracked eggs, but the staff are always happy to rectify the situation by allowing exchanges or refunds. We can always find someone to help us in the aisles which seems rare at a lot of stores these days, and the checkout line is never very long.The only downside I can think of is that you can't buy alcohol here now (although you used to be able to). But otherwise fair prices, good quality (if not, you can exchange or refund), lots of variety, friendly staff! Definitely a go-to grocery store!"
DC R.,"Washington, DC",5,9/29/19,Great experience. And amazing selections! Better than my local.Trader Joe's is my first priority on a trip!Easy access in Cambridge.
Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4,4/25/19,"I come here all the time to grocery shop, especially for snacks, for which they have a very wide selection. Don't be fooled though, not all of their prices are cheaper than competitors (including Whole Foods), so you gotta do your research. I especially love their mini mochi and cold brew latte pops. Do not buy their flowers no matter how tempted you may be by the low prices. They wither in about a day. And they no longer sell alcohol at this location. Sad."
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,6/23/18,"Average Trader Joe's and nothing special about this location. No food samples today :(Otherwise, place is clean and cashiers are friendly."
Tessa M.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",5,7/28/19,"I am a Trader Joes somewhat newbie, as they were not prevalently featured in areas I lived until three years ago. This Traders has a lovely selection and is well-kept (clean, nothing expired on the shelves, all produce tasty/fresh). It is a nicely sized location with convenient parking, and a Starbucks right next door if you need a quick fix. The associates are nice and friendly, one of which I now look for every time I come in, as she is such a sweet person! This is certainly my Traders of choice. It only has one flaw, which is when you try to leave you can only turn right and traffic makes uturning difficult if you came from the other direction. Otherwise, perfection!"
Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6/13/17,"How can you not like Trader Joes? It's like Whole Foods, but affordable and friendly for the entire family. Also, they have $3 buck wine! That's amazing!Similar to the other trader joes, this market has the standard joe-goods and has a fairly sizable parking lot. The flowers are always in season and they often have some fancy free dishes in the back corner. I will say that their card selection is slightly limited and they don't always have free coffee. But that's just picking at small things."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,6/15/17,"This place is crowded during the weekend, but its nowhere as crowded as the TJ in NYC's Union Square. You can push a cart around this TJ. The wine section is in the supermarket (its not a separate wine store) so you definitely need a cart. There is ample, free parking outside. It is not covered, but hey, its free!Some of my favorite items to buy are:-snap peas-Any meat that has flavor added, like the bulgogi beef.-Snacks. The snack aisle is my favorite aisle. Cheddar puffs, green pea snacks, tortilla chips and salsa. Mixed nuts. -Frozen food. I wasn't able to find the cauliflower pizza crust or mashed cauliflower. Maybe it was sold out.-Wines. $3 wine for making sangria. Reislings are cheap too. If you forget to bring a bag like me, you will be charged 10 cents per bag."

Court S.,"Oakland, CA",5,1/7/15,I've written a few reviews for Trader Joe's so I'm only limiting this review to their wine selection. I love all Tj's however this location has wine for sale. On one occasion they were providing samples of champagne.  Now that how I like to shop! I usually come here when I need to get a gift for someone and you never go wrong with a nice inexpensive bottle of wine for $5.99. I especially love that there are a few experts that will help you select the appropriate wine based on the gift receiver's demographic. Cheers!

Aditi V.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/19/17,"This is by far my favorite place to buy groceries. The produce is fresh and inexpensive. Also a pretty good selection of cheese and wine (probably the most inexpensive wine selection in the Boston area - inexpensive but good ! Get the Rieslings if that's your thing. They're really good here)In the frozen food sections - the dumplings , pork buns and cioppino (seafood stew) are delicious. Pro tip: NEVER shop here on a Sunday evening. It will be insanely crowded."
Vadim S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/19,"Trader Joe's makes me happy! I go there every week to get groceries and I find something new to try every time :-) They have a fun selection of products, lots of ready to eat or easy to cook items which saves a lot of my time and are quite delicious. I like their fresh produce section, the cheese (of course!) and the seafood sections. Most of my food comes from Trader Joe's and it's a great shopping experience every time!"

Maybe it was sold out.-Wines. $3 wine for making sangria. Reislings are cheap too. If you forget to bring a bag like me, you will be charged 10 cents per bag."
George H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,10/31/18,Relatively cheap grocery store in the area with a solid offering.Really love the trader Joe's branded snacks
Michael D.,"Providence, RI",5,4/16/19,"Nice store with a great friendly staff.  I visit often & Dave, the manager always goes out of his way to welcome me.  Always clean & so neatly organized.  Great music too."
Kenyetta S.,"Little Rock, AR",5,8/11/18,"One of the better locations I've seen, super clean and organized. Very friendly staff and were readily available to help. And a beautiful multicultural mural on the face of the store."
Court S.,"Oakland, CA",5,1/7/15,I've written a few reviews for Trader Joe's so I'm only limiting this review to their wine selection. I love all Tj's however this location has wine for sale. On one occasion they were providing samples of champagne.  Now that how I like to shop! I usually come here when I need to get a gift for someone and you never go wrong with a nice inexpensive bottle of wine for $5.99. I especially love that there are a few experts that will help you select the appropriate wine based on the gift receiver's demographic. Cheers!

Aditi V.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/19/17,"This is by far my favorite place to buy groceries. The produce is fresh and inexpensive. Also a pretty good selection of cheese and wine (probably the most inexpensive wine selection in the Boston area - inexpensive but good ! Get the Rieslings if that's your thing. They're really good here)In the frozen food sections - the dumplings , pork buns and cioppino (seafood stew) are delicious. Pro tip: NEVER shop here on a Sunday evening. It will be insanely crowded."
Vadim S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/19,"Trader Joe's makes me happy! I go there every week to get groceries and I find something new to try every time :-) They have a fun selection of products, lots of ready to eat or easy to cook items which saves a lot of my time and are quite delicious. I like their fresh produce section, the cheese (of course!) and the seafood sections. Most of my food comes from Trader Joe's and it's a great shopping experience every time!"
Mike Y.,"Cambridge, MA",1,7/7/18,"Around 8 PM on July 7, my cashier, N. Hannah, allowed my apples to fall on the floor and just put them back on the checkout belt like they hadn't just rolled under the station behind her. When my boyfriend said that we no longer needed an item, she told him to put it back. And when he left to do just that, she said to me, ""Are you roommates?"" I told her, no, that's my boyfriend. She just looked at me and said nothing-- just stared at me blankly. We're gay, there's nothing subtle about the way I treat my boyfriend in public, and I don't think the question was innocent. I noticed a large crucifix around her neck. We bagged everything in our own bags, and then she proceeded not to give us the bag discount. So, Point 1, don't let your employees ask about customers' private lives. I spent $160, but even if I had spent $5, it's none of your damn business.   Point 2, if you have religious beliefs that impel you to treat people differently, don't get a job that requires you to work with the public. If you're a nasty piece of work who doesn't get along with others, I hear working from home is nice.Point 3, if you have an employee that is giving out service that differs depending on whether she approves of the customer's lifestyle, you need to fire that person, and if you don't, that's on you."
Araxie Y.,"Malden, MA",5,3/21/16,"I've been to a handful of Trader Joe's but can't say I've found one thats blown me away with this kind of service.Aside from the usual shopping pleasures of delicious foods; I had one type of cookie I came hunting for at this location during my most recent visit. The staff couldn't find it on the shelves and were terribly curious to see if they had ordered it before at all. I informed them it was in fact a Trader's Joe cookie, the Meyer Lemon thin ones, and they spent 3 employees and 30 minutes searching for it. They found it in the inventory and managed to give me a few boxes during my checkout!Talk about amazing. What was even more incredible was the manager noticed there was no set place for those cookies on their shelves anymore so she had them make room and keep them in stock for good. Very happy with the outcome as I love these cookies and will be returning often for them!"
Guli K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,5/6/20,Lines moved fast and layout was well organized. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Was surprised at how well stocked they were during these times.
Anna F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/18/20,"I love this TJ's. It's my favorite one in the area. They are fully stocked, even in these times, and they were one of the first to take super precautions: lines with markers for standing 6ft apart, wipes for carts, now they're doing 1 way aisles. The staff is quite friendly too. Avocados from Mexico are always great to get, fresh herbs, cheeses, Italian prosciutto (my new favorite product), frozen goods (of course), kosher and organic meat, handmade flour tortillas, canned tomatoes grape leaves & green olives, teas, seltzer, and constantly lovely surprises."
H. S.,"Boston, MA",1,9/7/20,"When I mentioned to the employee behind the customer service counter early this morning on September 7 that masks should be worn above the nose, (both he and other employees were wearing masks below their nose and as chin straps) he lowered his mask completely, reached out his arm and stated that he was 6 feet away so ""no problem"" as he spoke at me.Given the respiratory transmission of this virus, the science we now know, and my experience as an ER doctor, I think it is inexcusable that Trader Joe's allows employees to not wear a mask inside their stores unless they are ""within 6 feet of someone else"".  There is no excuse for putting the lives of their customers, employees and family members at risk at risk with a store policy."
Sfo B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,8/7/19,"I love Trader Joe's stores. Their stores are not nearly as big as the WF stores, but one can find many good products at an excellent price, often much better than the WF. I often get fruits and vegetables, olive oil, juice, pasta sauce and frozen foods from this store. One star deducted for not carrying beer and wine. I wish they carry these like other Trader Joe's stores."
Gretchen B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,12/28/19,"I LOVE Trader Joe's, and I especially love this particular store because their employees are so delightful. Everyone is always very helpful and has a great attitude. It makes shopping so much better when you're around kind people. One time, the person in front of me in line left the store and I got up to the register and noticed they walked out w/o their keys. I ran out the door and found them and gave them their keys. I came back in and the cashier had flowers for me that the lady working in the flower area picked out while I was in the parking lot giving the person their keys back. I was taken aback and the cashier said ""I like to celebrate good deeds and kindness. We need more of it in this world and I appreciate you ran out and gave this person their keys back. That was very nice."" I mean...WOW! I was floored and thanked him and the lady who was working in the flower area over and over. I certainly did not expect that for just doing the right thing that I'd hope anyone would do if they were my keys. This store gets VERY crowded on Sundays so I try to avoid it then, but any other time it's fine and easy to navigate through (except maybe before a winter storm...but aren't all stores in New England crowded then as people freak out?)I used to love that they carried wine at this store but now that the Allston store does, this one does not. It's OK though...they have all of the amazing Trader Joe's foods/products I love, and again, I cannot stress how awesome the employees are. It's a pleasure to shop here."
Diane Z.,"Fremont, CA",5,9/6/19,"5 stars for excellent customer service! My boyfriend and I come here regularly for groceries and have run into some issues such as meat going bad before the best-by date or having cracked eggs, but the staff are always happy to rectify the situation by allowing exchanges or refunds. We can always find someone to help us in the aisles which seems rare at a lot of stores these days, and the checkout line is never very long.The only downside I can think of is that you can't buy alcohol here now (although you used to be able to). But otherwise fair prices, good quality (if not, you can exchange or refund), lots of variety, friendly staff! Definitely a go-to grocery store!"
DC R.,"Washington, DC",5,9/29/19,Great experience. And amazing selections! Better than my local.Trader Joe's is my first priority on a trip!Easy access in Cambridge.
Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4,4/25/19,"I come here all the time to grocery shop, especially for snacks, for which they have a very wide selection. Don't be fooled though, not all of their prices are cheaper than competitors (including Whole Foods), so you gotta do your research. I especially love their mini mochi and cold brew latte pops. Do not buy their flowers no matter how tempted you may be by the low prices. They wither in about a day. And they no longer sell alcohol at this location. Sad."
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,6/23/18,"Average Trader Joe's and nothing special about this location. No food samples today :(Otherwise, place is clean and cashiers are friendly."
Tessa M.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",5,7/28/19,"I am a Trader Joes somewhat newbie, as they were not prevalently featured in areas I lived until three years ago. This Traders has a lovely selection and is well-kept (clean, nothing expired on the shelves, all produce tasty/fresh). It is a nicely sized location with convenient parking, and a Starbucks right next door if you need a quick fix. The associates are nice and friendly, one of which I now look for every time I come in, as she is such a sweet person! This is certainly my Traders of choice. It only has one flaw, which is when you try to leave you can only turn right and traffic makes uturning difficult if you came from the other direction. Otherwise, perfection!"
Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6/13/17,"How can you not like Trader Joes? It's like Whole Foods, but affordable and friendly for the entire family. Also, they have $3 buck wine! That's amazing!Similar to the other trader joes, this market has the standard joe-goods and has a fairly sizable parking lot. The flowers are always in season and they often have some fancy free dishes in the back corner. I will say that their card selection is slightly limited and they don't always have free coffee. But that's just picking at small things."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,6/15/17,"This place is crowded during the weekend, but its nowhere as crowded as the TJ in NYC's Union Square. You can push a cart around this TJ. The wine section is in the supermarket (its not a separate wine store) so you definitely need a cart. There is ample, free parking outside.

But otherwise fair prices, good quality (if not, you can exchange or refund), lots of variety, friendly staff! Definitely a go-to grocery store!"
DC R.,"Washington, DC",5,9/29/19,Great experience. And amazing selections! Better than my local.Trader Joe's is my first priority on a trip!Easy access in Cambridge.
Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4,4/25/19,"I come here all the time to grocery shop, especially for snacks, for which they have a very wide selection. Don't be fooled though, not all of their prices are cheaper than competitors (including Whole Foods), so you gotta do your research. I especially love their mini mochi and cold brew latte pops. Do not buy their flowers no matter how tempted you may be by the low prices. They wither in about a day. And they no longer sell alcohol at this location. Sad."
Kaori M.,"Boston, MA",3,6/23/18,"Average Trader Joe's and nothing special about this location. No food samples today :(Otherwise, place is clean and cashiers are friendly."
Tessa M.,"Roslindale, Boston, MA",5,7/28/19,"I am a Trader Joes somewhat newbie, as they were not prevalently featured in areas I lived until three years ago. This Traders has a lovely selection and is well-kept (clean, nothing expired on the shelves, all produce tasty/fresh). It is a nicely sized location with convenient parking, and a Starbucks right next door if you need a quick fix. The associates are nice and friendly, one of which I now look for every time I come in, as she is such a sweet person! This is certainly my Traders of choice. It only has one flaw, which is when you try to leave you can only turn right and traffic makes uturning difficult if you came from the other direction. Otherwise, perfection!"
Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6/13/17,"How can you not like Trader Joes? It's like Whole Foods, but affordable and friendly for the entire family. Also, they have $3 buck wine! That's amazing!Similar to the other trader joes, this market has the standard joe-goods and has a fairly sizable parking lot. The flowers are always in season and they often have some fancy free dishes in the back corner. I will say that their card selection is slightly limited and they don't always have free coffee. But that's just picking at small things."
Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",4,6/15/17,"This place is crowded during the weekend, but its nowhere as crowded as the TJ in NYC's Union Square. You can push a cart around this TJ. The wine section is in the supermarket (its not a separate wine store) so you definitely need a cart. There is ample, free parking outside. It is not covered, but hey, its free!Some of my favorite items to buy are:-snap peas-Any meat that has flavor added, like the bulgogi beef.-Snacks. The snack aisle is my favorite aisle. Cheddar puffs, green pea snacks, tortilla chips and salsa. Mixed nuts. -Frozen food. I wasn't able to find the cauliflower pizza crust or mashed cauliflower. Maybe it was sold out.-Wines. $3 wine for making sangria. Reislings are cheap too. If you forget to bring a bag like me, you will be charged 10 cents per bag."
George H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5,10/31/18,Relatively cheap grocery store in the area with a solid offering.Really love the trader Joe's branded snacks

Court S.,"Oakland, CA",5,1/7/15,I've written a few reviews for Trader Joe's so I'm only limiting this review to their wine selection. I love all Tj's however this location has wine for sale. On one occasion they were providing samples of champagne.  Now that how I like to shop! I usually come here when I need to get a gift for someone and you never go wrong with a nice inexpensive bottle of wine for $5.99. I especially love that there are a few experts that will help you select the appropriate wine based on the gift receiver's demographic. Cheers!

Aditi V.,"Cambridge, MA",5,3/19/17,"This is by far my favorite place to buy groceries. The produce is fresh and inexpensive. Also a pretty good selection of cheese and wine (probably the most inexpensive wine selection in the Boston area - inexpensive but good ! Get the Rieslings if that's your thing. They're really good here)In the frozen food sections - the dumplings , pork buns and cioppino (seafood stew) are delicious. Pro tip: NEVER shop here on a Sunday evening. It will be insanely crowded."
Vadim S.,"Seattle, WA",5,1/28/19,"Trader Joe's makes me happy! I go there every week to get groceries and I find something new to try every time :-) They have a fun selection of products, lots of ready to eat or easy to cook items which saves a lot of my time and are quite delicious. I like their fresh produce section, the cheese (of course!) and the seafood sections. Most of my food comes from Trader Joe's and it's a great shopping experience every time!"
Mike Y.,"Cambridge, MA",1,7/7/18,"Around 8 PM on July 7, my cashier, N. Hannah, allowed my apples to fall on the floor and just put them back on the checkout belt like they hadn't just rolled under the station behind her. When my boyfriend said that we no longer needed an item, she told him to put it back. And when he left to do just that, she said to me, ""Are you roommates?"" I told her, no, that's my boyfriend. She just looked at me and said nothing-- just stared at me blankly. We're gay, there's nothing subtle about the way I treat my boyfriend in public, and I don't think the question was innocent. I noticed a large crucifix around her neck. We bagged everything in our own bags, and then she proceeded not to give us the bag discount. So, Point 1, don't let your employees ask about customers' private lives. I spent $160, but even if I had spent $5, it's none of your damn business.   Point 2, if you have religious beliefs that impel you to treat people differently, don't get a job that requires you to work with the public. If you're a nasty piece of work who doesn't get along with others, I hear working from home is nice.Point 3, if you have an employee that is giving out service that differs depending on whether she approves of the customer's lifestyle, you need to fire that person, and if you don't, that's on you."
Araxie Y.,"Malden, MA",5,3/21/16,"I've been to a handful of Trader Joe's but can't say I've found one thats blown me away with this kind of service.Aside from the usual shopping pleasures of delicious foods; I had one type of cookie I came hunting for at this location during my most recent visit. The staff couldn't find it on the shelves and were terribly curious to see if they had ordered it before at all. I informed them it was in fact a Trader's Joe cookie, the Meyer Lemon thin ones, and they spent 3 employees and 30 minutes searching for it. They found it in the inventory and managed to give me a few boxes during my checkout!Talk about amazing. What was even more incredible was the manager noticed there was no set place for those cookies on their shelves anymore so she had them make room and keep them in stock for good. Very happy with the outcome as I love these cookies and will be returning often for them!"
Guli K.,"Cambridge, MA",5,5/6/20,Lines moved fast and layout was well organized. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Was surprised at how well stocked they were during these times.
Anna F.,"Cambridge, MA",5,4/18/20,"I love this TJ's. It's my favorite one in the area. They are fully stocked, even in these times, and they were one of the first to take super precautions: lines with markers for standing 6ft apart, wipes for carts, now they're doing 1 way aisles. The staff is quite friendly too. Avocados from Mexico are always great to get, fresh herbs, cheeses, Italian prosciutto (my new favorite product), frozen goods (of course), kosher and organic meat, handmade flour tortillas, canned tomatoes grape leaves & green olives, teas, seltzer, and constantly lovely surprises."
H. S.,"Boston, MA",1,9/7/20,"When I mentioned to the employee behind the customer service counter early this morning on September 7 that masks should be worn above the nose, (both he and other employees were wearing masks below their nose and as chin straps) he lowered his mask completely, reached out his arm and stated that he was 6 feet away so ""no problem"" as he spoke at me.Given the respiratory transmission of this virus, the science we now know, and my experience as an ER doctor, I think it is inexcusable that Trader Joe's allows employees to not wear a mask inside their stores unless they are ""within 6 feet of someone else"".  There is no excuse for putting the lives of their customers, employees and family members at risk at risk with a store policy."
Sfo B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,8/7/19,"I love Trader Joe's stores. Their stores are not nearly as big as the WF stores, but one can find many good products at an excellent price, often much better than the WF. I often get fruits and vegetables, olive oil, juice, pasta sauce and frozen foods from this store. One star deducted for not carrying beer and wine. I wish they carry these like other Trader Joe's stores."
Gretchen B.,"Cambridge, MA",5,12/28/19,"I LOVE Trader Joe's, and I especially love this particular store because their employees are so delightful. Everyone is always very helpful and has a great attitude. It makes shopping so much better when you're around kind people. One time, the person in front of me in line left the store and I got up to the register and noticed they walked out w/o their keys. I ran out the door and found them and gave them their keys. I came back in and the cashier had flowers for me that the lady working in the flower area picked out while I was in the parking lot giving the person their keys back. I was taken aback and the cashier said ""I like to celebrate good deeds and kindness. We need more of it in this world and I appreciate you ran out and gave this person their keys back. That was very nice."" I mean...WOW! I was floored and thanked him and the lady who was working in the flower area over and over. I certainly did not expect that for just doing the right thing that I'd hope anyone would do if they were my keys. This store gets VERY crowded on Sundays so I try to avoid it then, but any other time it's fine and easy to navigate through (except maybe before a winter storm...but aren't all stores in New England crowded then as people freak out?)I used to love that they carried wine at this store but now that the Allston store does, this one does not. It's OK though...they have all of the amazing Trader Joe's foods/products I love, and again, I cannot stress how awesome the employees are. It's a pleasure to shop here."

Celia P.,"Boston, MA",5,4/19/20,"This is a Covid-19 compliance review of Trader Joe's in Brookline: These guys get a flat out A. They had an employee sanitizing the carts, a line out front with six-foot markers, and they let people in only when the same number came out. Every employee was wearing a mask and gloves, and I only saw a single customer not wearing a face covering. They have aisles marked one way to help monitor traffic flow, and six foot markers for the queues, customers were not great about the six-foot rule but from what I can tell TJ's is doing everything they can to protect their employees and customers. Probably the best of any place I've been in Boston to-date."
Lauren K.,"Narragansett, RI",5,4/18/20,I love this Trader Joe's! The employees are always so friendly and helpful. Gloria may be the sweetest and chicest lady I have ever met. She is a ray of sunshine during this pandemic.
Juaquin C.,"Arlington, MA",5,8/20/20,HAVE you even TRIED green tea mochi from Trader Joe's? Chocolate-covered espresso beans? Lightly-sweetened coconut strips? $3 huge pack of pepperoni? $5 bottle of wine? NO? Then I don't even wanna hear your opinion. I don't. This place is heat. Only thing is they don't have Wortchestrishitre sauce. But it's ok. Pour one out for TJ's 2020. Love the Hawaiian shirt drip keep it uppp hustlahssss
Cass F.,"Boston, MA",1,10/13/20,"I know the parking attendants are pretty aggressive here, but I've never had a problem with them until today.  Whoever was out there just fifteen minutes ago kept pounding on my window and wouldn't stop until the car in front of me was able to get a spot and I could drive away.  But once I parked, he stood right in front of my car.  I was too scared to get out since I was a little ways from the entrance and he was a rather large man, and since it's a rainy day, there wasn't a line out front, so I was pretty isolated.  After five minutes, I left to go home without ever leaving my car, because this attendant just refused to leave me alone."
Devon K.,"Boston, MA",4,8/14/19,"According to my friend this is there 7th busiest Trader Joe's in the country and boy would I believe that! It doesn't matter what day or time you come here, there will always be tons of people inside. This location is right in Coolidge Corner but it still has its own parking lot and a great variety of items. Definitely smaller than I would like, but it has al your basic needs. They have a great frozen section and an entire wall of snacks so what's not to love? They are missing some items that can be found at other nearby locations, but if you're in the area it's worth checking out! I love their cheese selection- perfect for a charcuterie board! Also, the last time I was here the cashier gave me flowers and it made my whole day!"
Anatoli L.,"Stamford, CT",5,12/17/19,"I don't live in Brookline, we were visiting friends there - but it is always great to have Trader Joe's around as this is my favorite grocery store. This store is large and spacious, reasonably easy to navigate, and service is always good, as it is a hallmark of pretty much any Trader Joe's. As I live in CT, where TJ'S only sells beer, visiting wine and liquor section at Trader Joe's is always a special treat - great selection."
Latoya G.,"Boston, MA",5,9/7/19,"Back again. Picked up a few more items. A lot of things I picked up the first time. Today, while cashing out, the cashier asked me if I had my own bags, I answered yes and then asked if I knew about the raffle. I answered ""no"". She advised me every Monday they pick a name from the raffle and the winner get $15 off their next visit. So my neighbor, sister and I were able to put our names in the raffles. She advised us, if no one asks you, you ask for it yourself. Very nice of her."
Sebastien L.,"Montreal, Canada",3,5/5/20,Did find great products but was kinda expensive for stuffs like treats and chocolate cookies was my first time in USA back in february Also a lot of shelves were half empty and a lot of stock missing so I've been pretty disappointed with my 1st time in american supermarket
Mari S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,8/12/20,"Boycott the Trader Joe's in Brookline, Ma. The reason is that employees report sexual harassment, and the management refuses to help them!"
Bruce K.,"Charlotte, NC",5,2/10/18,"I was super pleased to see that this Trader Joe's was open until ten PM which is awesome. As well, it's located right near the Coolidge Corner T station which made it extremely convenient for me.It has the same stuff that I've seen in other TJ's including their own brands of beer, a lot of wine and (not in North Carolina, spirits). Great aisles of cheese and crackers, fresh meats, interesting frozen stuff you won't find in other supermarkets.I don't know that you can do a complete shop at TJ's but you can sure fill out your pantry with all sorts of delicious items. Perfect!"
Nicole R.,"North Andover, MA",4,1/11/19,"This Trader Joe's is always crowded, which isn't surprising considering it's right next to the Coolidge Corner T stop. They're also open an hour later than most other TJ's, which usually close at 9:00pm. There's two register stations by each entry: one by the entrance near the T and another near the parking lot entrance. Even when it's busy the cash registers tend to be well-staffed so you don't have to wait in line for too long. I'd definitely recommend taking public transit here over driving. The parking lot, especially in the middle of the day, is a hassle to navigate. Getting in and out is difficult and sometimes you may have to wait for a space to become vacant. You can only park there for about an hour and there's always security guards roaming the parking lot to enforce that rule. Metered parking might be a better alternative depending on how much you're buying and how long you'll be in the area."
Grace L.,"Honolulu, HI",5,12/1/17,"It's Christmas time which means TJs has the best selection of Christmas goodies in store. From peppermint bark to ugly sweater cookie kits, TJs has everything you need to throw your festive party. On the off season side, TJs has a good selection of everything you need AND it's exceptionally priced. My all time favorite is their frozen chicken gyoza, microwaveable chicken tikka masala, and Riesling white wine. Or to be completely honest, I've loved everything I've bought from Trader Joe's. I promise this store won't disappoint!"
Christine B.,"Brighton, Boston, MA",5,5/3/18,"My go to spot for grocery shopping! The inventory is plentiful and I can pretty much find all that I need at this store--everything from food, snacks, alcohol (yup that's right), greeting cards, and even plants/succulents.  The produce is fresh and they have really amazing products that you can't find anywhere else...speculous ice cream, deep dish chocolate chip cookie, miniature ice cream cones--need I say more?! I also always look forward to fall and christmas season here because they sell products that really get you into the spirit. During the fall, the place is all about pumpkin. You can get cookies, bread, cheesecake, ice cream--you name it--all featuring this fall favorite. And during the holiday season, nothing screams ""the most wonderful time of the year"" than the mini Christmas trees with ornaments, gingerbread house kits, ugly sweater cookie sets, advent calendars, etc. that are on sale. They not only make great gifts but they're perfect for you and your friends to ring in the holidays. Just keep in mind that the store can get packed during the weekends and after work hours- so plan accordingly. Didn't know a grocery store can bring me so much joy--- keep being awesome TJs!!!"
Kathryn L.,"North Bethesda, MD",4,3/8/17,"Friendly staff holding down this TJ that's front & center on busy Beacon Street with a huge & very organized layout. All of my go to items are here plus a few new to eyes were in stock. The Beer, Wine & Champagne is a benefit as Maryland stores don't offer.Same expedient check out islands, unmatchable prices & tasty taste stations.Trader Joe's works no matter which store you go to.

App D.,"Brookline, MA",3,8/17/19,"We are 50-year residents of Brookline, MA and have shopped at Trader's in Coolidge Corner since it opened in 1996. We reviewed Trader's in Brookline on June 15, 2013 and again on January 3, 2015. Major changes in operations over the years. Open bulk bins of the 1990s are long gone. Wines introduced around 1998 have become more sophisticated, and the store now features craft beers plus a full liquor license--very rare among Massachusetts groceries.The location across from the Coolidge Corner T-stop on the C branch of the Green Line--the first East Coast location for Trader's--makes the store accessible to almost everyone in urban Boston, and it is almost always busy. Probably only the Union Square location in New York City is busier. When you can manage, best times to visit are early morning around 8 am and late evening around 9 pm.Late summer of 2019 features a revised selection of cheeses, including Asiago from Italy, a genuine DOP mediano--made with raw milk and aged 4-6 months--at a very reasonable price. Trader's has had nothing comparable since the former ""Italian mountain cheese"" last seen more then ten years ago. Recent years have also seen fresh salmon and scallops plus a much improved selection of fresh produce. We continue to lament loss of grass-fed Australian beef and New Zealand lamb. The latter still appears once in a while.New England operations of Trader's are now heavily regimented out of Natick, MA, and local employees know little or nothing about them. One example is packaging. It manages to comply with the wild varieties of local restrictions, but it is utilitarian rather than environmentally positive. Fresh fish, for example, are packaged in a composite, clear thermoform of PET and EVA. No recycling program accepts that."
Tina K.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,12/13/18,"I've been a loyal Trader Joe's customer for the last few years as I moved around and lived in a few different states, but I must say this branch disappoints and is subpar compared to other branches I frequented.The Coolidge Corner branch is not well stocked; if you go in the afternoon on a weekend--and even on weekdays sometimes--chances are many items have run out. I never had this issue on a weekly basis with other TJ's in Portland, ME, and Southern California. The managers should know that this branch is really busy and should know to have more items in stock.It also feels really awkward to get samples here. There are up to three different stations: one for food; one for non-alcoholic beverage and/or cheese and crackers type of snack; and one for alcoholic beverage. Except for the food sample station by the refrigerated section, you have to ask for a sample. I love how the Portland TJ's instead has a beverage dispenser at the food sample station, so you can help yourself to some great tasting TJ's beverage to help the food sample go down. The Coolidge Corner TJ's also has the same sample for many days and weeks in a row, which is not helpful. The Portland branch rotates its sample offerings every day, so even when I went three times a week, I got to sample three different items (and therefore were more likely to purchase items that were otherwise not on my radar).The worst thing about this TJ's is the customer service. TJ's built its reputation on amazing customer service among a few other success factors. The crew at this TJ's doesn't seem to care about customers that much. I asked a crew member if the store still had a certain seasonal product, so he left to find out but never got back to me. A real letdown.I still shop here, but it's no longer the pleasant experience it used to be when I lived in other states. I used to look forward to grocery shopping at TJ's. Sadly now it feels like a chore that I just wanted to do my shopping as quickly as possible and get out of there."
Amy C.,"San Mateo, CA",5,1/29/16,"TJs is my favorite grocery store that I have ever been to. The prices are reasonable, the produce is fresh, and they have some amazing TJ-only items. I love their ""just the clusters"" cereal (like honey oats and clusters but without the late) and their honey Greek yogurt. The frozen food section is also amazing - I've tried their pizza, chicken tikka masala, and dumplings and they have all turned out well upon reheating in the frying pan, microwave, or oven.This location has alcohol - both the store brand 3 buck chuck and a variety of other cheap beers and wines. You can get a bottle of wine that isn't obviously 3 buck chuck for $5-7, which is a steal. They also normally have a wine tasting and a food sampling section going on when they are open.Even though this location is in a busy area, it almost never gets overwhelmingly crowded and the check out lines move fast. My favorite place to grocery shop!"
Yonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,4/21/18,So sweet to have a Traders close by to the hotel we were staying at for the first 2 nights in Boston. Convenient and large spacious.
Lisa A.,"Boston, MA",4,1/3/17,"If you've ever lived in New York City and had to experience the insanity of the Union Square Trader Joe's, you'd appreciate how wonderful this TJ's is. It's calming and zen AF compared to the Union Square one. Sheesh. Now, that's not to say this place doesn't get busy. It does. The good thing is, the cashiers are incredibly efficient and the layout of the store gives you enough space to move around (for the most part) and peruse through everything. Going to TJ's is like an adventure. Will there be any cauliflower rice today (I'll take 8 packages, thanks)? What new snacks will they have? WILL ANY OF THE AVOCADOS BE RIPE!? So many emotions. I love this place because it's an affordable one stop shop for basically all my kitchen staples. Aka: they sell booze. Yeah, you read that correctly. You can get wine, beer, and liquor here. Want a buzz? Two buck chuck. Want to be a baller? Grab some snazzy brews from San Diego (ICU Ballast Point #sculpinFTW) or splurge on a bottle of rose (rose all day). Anyway, like all Trader Joe's locations, the parking lot is a nightmare. Good thing the T stops basically across the street. Woo, yeaaaaah grocery shopping! #adulting"
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",5,7/6/18,"While I am not a big fan of the Stop&Shop down the street, this Trader Joe's is the best grocery spot for Brookline residents. Clean, well stocked, well organized and well maintained is all I have to say about the Trader Joe's in Brookline. There were so many staff throughout the store, at both ends of registers (where all registers were open), and management at the service desk. Everyone was helpful, fast, and friendly, and helped endure and clean, concise, and easily navigable store. I was able to get everything I was looking for, and actually more. While parking can be sort of tough, when I went on a busy weekend, their were three policemen (or valet parking guys.... surprisingly, it was difficult to tell) directing cars and helping to assist in the traffic. They do have a parking lot in the back, which holds roughly fifteen cars. While I should recognize that if you haven't been to Trader Joe's in the past, you should know they are not a full grocery store, carry only Trader Joe's brand products, and don't have a full selection of any department. Items are typically consistently stocked (except seasonal items), which can be a good or bad thing depending on any customer's view. Since I enjoy lots of Trader Joe's snack items, dairy items, and even vitamins and candy, I always take the opportunity to go there. Plus, the prices are always really low and never vary (or even increase!). All in all, this is a grocery store that will have what you are looking for and is dependable. For a plus, this location has beer and wine. While not the largest or most spacious, it surely beats the appalling conditions of the undersized Stop&Shop down the street. Plus, with short checkout lines and twenty registers all open on weekends, this place will always get my business! 5 stars for Trader Joe's."
Celia P.,"Boston, MA",5,4/19/20,"This is a Covid-19 compliance review of Trader Joe's in Brookline: These guys get a flat out A. They had an employee sanitizing the carts, a line out front with six-foot markers, and they let people in only when the same number came out. Every employee was wearing a mask and gloves, and I only saw a single customer not wearing a face covering. They have aisles marked one way to help monitor traffic flow, and six foot markers for the queues, customers were not great about the six-foot rule but from what I can tell TJ's is doing everything they can to protect their employees and customers. Probably the best of any place I've been in Boston to-date."
